              <p><img src="http://www.smartcape.org.za/uploads/pics/ubuntu.jpg" title="Ubuntu" alt="" />
Years ago I was wholeheartedly an Ubuntu Linux fanboy. Every waking moment I spent playing with it and browsing the support forums to discuss problems, solutions, and unrelated topics. I was a highschooler running in the big leagues trying to help anyone and everyone I could. They were the first online community I felt undoubtedly attached to. They changed my life as a developer and student. All of a sudden I realized I was incredibly indebted to them.</p>

<p>After realizing how much the people in the community meant to me, I began doing whatever I could to help. I started compiling solutions to common problems into tutorials and setup guides. These started to be very highly viewed. It wasn’t enough. I began working on a project to help myself use Ubuntu better offline. That project became <a href="https://launchpad.net/keryx/" title="Keryx">Keryx</a>. Before I knew it, there were thousands of downloads and I was receiving emails from users across the globe. Users in Africa, users in Asia, users in small towns in the US. It was incredible, but here I am. There’s nothing special about me, only the approach I happened to take.</p>

<p>You see, I decided to try to help people. I began to teach newcomers the ropes of using Ubuntu. It didn’t matter that I was just some naive highschool student either. When I came across a question I didn’t know how to answer, I googled and googled and googled until I came across something that would at least help put them on the right path. I am not a genius by any definition of the word. No. All I did was tried to help teach others.</p>

<p>There are a great many reasons for mentoring and teaching, and here are some of the things I’ve learned:</p>

<h3>1. Teaching requires you to learn</h3>

<p>You might think this is a bit backwards. A student is supposed to be the one doing the learning, however that’s not quite the case. As a teacher you’re forced to learn. Students are constantly asking questions. The kinds of questions they’ll ask you are ones you may never expect. Something you find obvious and take for granted will be questioned right before your very eyes. It will force you to reexamine your beliefs, get a better understanding of them, and reenforce everything you know. If it turns out you were actually wrong, then congratulations! You’re more enlightened.</p>

<h3>2. Teaching builds relationships</h3>

<p>I cannot tell you how many incredible people I have met by simply giving a helping hand. I know that at some point in my life, I needed help too. The people who helped me solve my problems never expected anything in return. They truly cared about me. Helping someone learn builds trust and relationships that aren’t easy to make otherwise. That’s why working with a team of people can quickly feel like family. After all, that’s what strong families usually do. They help each other whenever they can.</p>

<h3>3. Teaching leads to new opportunities</h3>

<p>As you mentor and teach people, you become more respected. If you’re doing a good job, you’re surely to be talked up whether you like the praise or not. All it takes is one person to recommend you and before you know it, you’re sitting with the best of them. Sometimes you’ll get introduced to someone you’ve always looked up to. You’ll feel like a hack, after all, you started “teaching” because you just wanted to help. You still don’t know anything compared to them. But that’s not what matters. What matters is you’ve inspired someone. You’ve put a smile on their face. You’ve helped them become a better person.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/do-things-tell-people.jpg" title="Do things. Tell people." alt="Do things. Tell people." /></p>

<p>You might not realize it yet, but your actions shine very bright. You don’t have to consider yourself an expert to teach or mentor. You don’t have to be one either. All you’ve got to do is share what knowledge you do have, expertise will follow. An expert isn’t someone who is always right. An expert is someone who can learn, adapt, and help others understand.</p>

<p>Fake your way to becoming an expert. That’s what they’ve all done anyways.</p>

              <p>There is a lot of criticism over the education system these days, and I’ve <a href="http://excid3.com/blog/looking-back-at-what-i-learned-at-college/" title="What I Learned At College">written about it</a> in the past as well. Online education is becoming popular these days and it’s interesting to see how things are improving.</p>

<p>In the past, online education was rough. I took a Cisco course in highschool that was insanely boring. Read all these articles, then take a quiz, get your grade. Did I learn anything? Nope. I felt like I was, the teachers felt like we were learning, but nothing stuck. If something doesn’t stick with you, did you really learn it?</p>

<p>Programming is one of the topics that can be better taught online. This past weekend <a href="http://codeschool.com" title="Code School">Code School</a> had all of their courses for free. I took the opportunity to go through as many courses as possible in the two days I had available. It was wonderful.</p>

<p>Combining a bit of personality and cheesiness, the courses were each unique. Every one had a different theme that made them rememberable. CSS Cross Country took skiing persona, which fit nicely into the idea of making your design clean and simple.</p>

<p><img src="https://d1ffx7ull4987f.cloudfront.net/images/screenshots/large/1/screenshot-0x00000004411370-cfd7ed37bf7863b6ec17a9bc43407b7c.jpg" alt="Rails For Zombies" /></p>

<p>The format of each course is well laid out. First you watch a short video, and then complete a series of challenges on each. There are several sets of videos and challenges for each; building upon what you learned in the last section. At the end of the course you feel confident about what you learned, and the videos and challenges are great references for building things on your own. Having done most, if not all, of the topics before, it was interesting to see how they’d play out for someone experienced in the field of web development. Going through the courses solidified my understanding of lots of topics, even though I skipped the videos and went directly to the challenges in most.</p>

<p>While the content is great, you sometimes finish the course thinking “Cool, this isn’t hard, but I still have no idea where to start building a real program.” This is probably inherent to any educational course. The student needs to be able to have an idea of what they want to build, and through that, they begin to see how what they’ve learned applies to a real world application.</p>

<p>Completing courses wins you awesome prizes, sometimes Code School cash for future purchases, sometimes you get a month of <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a> or another discount. Code School is without a doubt one of the best places to get your feet wet with some seriously great topics in web development. Pair that with Railscasts and Peepcode video casts to teach you more specific implementations, and you’ll be a long ways down the path to becoming a great developer.</p>

<p>It’s awesome to see online education becoming a viable alternative to learning. With the incredibly affordable pricing, accessibility, and community, I can’t see a reason why the internet couldn’t become the default learning platform in the future.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning Rails, give the <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies">Rails for Zombies Code School course</a> a shot. It’s free, and a great way to try before you buy.</p>

              <p>After a few years, the fun of birthdays wears off. You’re bombarded with a sea of candy, gifts, and cards that you care about reading. As you grow older, you (hopefully) become less interested in the gifts you’re given and more about the idea of giving. You come to appreciate the relationships you’ve built over any physical items you get.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve begun using my birthday as more of a milestone than anything. I don’t want gifts. I want moments to remember. Use your birthday to reflect on your past year and make sure that you’re twice the person you were before. Use it as a gut check to make sure you’re going in the right direction.</p>

<p>Last year on my birthday I was beginning my move to St. Louis. I was nothing more than the enthusiastic, inspired kid just out of college who wanted to change the world. I had no idea how things actually worked, and of course little to no responsibilities at the time just like everyone else fresh out of college.</p>

<p>Since then, however, I’ve grown immensely. I’m nothing like the person I was last year. I’ve met more incredible people in my field in the last few months than I have in my lifetime. Thanks to each and every one of you for inspiring me to become a better person and a better developer. There is no way I would be here without you guys.</p>

<p>A year is a long time. Make sure you take time reflect on how things are going. Take a break if you need to. Just remember that you’ve only got once chance. The last thing you want is to become old and regret the things you didn’t do.</p>

<p><strong>Make sure the people in your life know how much they mean to you.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you guys.</p>
