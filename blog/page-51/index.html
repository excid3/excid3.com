              <p>Something that has been on my mind recently is the quality of software I produce. I’ll be graduating in a few short months. I feel it’s absolutely crucial that I write elegant code so that when I begin applying for jobs, I’ll have great code samples.</p>

<p>This is an idea I don’t actually believe. It’s been engrained in my mind and I don’t know why. Throughout school I’ve been trained to do things “better” so that I can get better grades.</p>

<p>In reality, I’m not sure this translates well into the business world. Writing “better” software means getting things done sooner and iterating more often. Assignments in school are one shot. You either do well or you don’t and it’s over after that.</p>

<p>Building businesses and software typically aren’t like this. You’re given the it a go, and you present it early, draw feedback, revise, and launch. Once you’ve launched, you can continue iterating and maybe even recover from a somewhat failed launch.</p>

<p>It all depends on your heart and motivation. Are you ready to accept failure? Heck no! Are you willing to pivot? Yeah, it’s what I have to do.</p>

<p>I know a lot of fellow developers and students who dislike showing their work until it is finished. One class project I am a part of consists of our team building a website to manage campus tour visitor registrations. Since this is our first and only major project of our entire Bachelors degrees, we decided an agile approach would be best. We iterate, present it to the client, make sure it’s something that will help them in the end. Not surprisingly, one of my team members is completely against showing our client the product before it is polished and complete. No matter how much arguing we do, he stands his ground that testing is not very important until the product is finished.</p>

<p>We only have a semester for implementation and have class and work outside of this project. There is certainly no time to rewrite the project from scratch if the client doesn’t like our approach so it is imperative we start getting feedback right away.</p>

<p>Of course we aren’t going to present them with bug ridden code, but as we complete features, we certainly want to know if they like them.</p>

<p>I felt the same way when I launched <a href="http://keryxproject.org">Keryx</a>. This was a project I spent many months on. I was naive at the time, and just release an incomplete application to the public. Not expecting anyone to care, I was pleasantly surprised when people started talking about it. Without releasing early, I wouldn’t have felt any drive to continue development. It did enough of what I wanted, still horribly incomplete, but people’s reactions drove me the extra mile. Now I have something I can be proud of, I have continued iterating on Keryx with help from several unbelievable volunteers and we have surpassed 50,000 downloads. This naive approach could have ended there, but instead it has brought me much more, even to tears at times through some incredibly heartfelt thank you’s I have received.</p>

<p>So don’t be ashamed of anything you do. Show everyone you can, be proud of what you accomplished. If someone says it’s crap, be humble about it. Ask them what is wrong, how you can improve it, and do so. Nothing can stop you if you hustle hard enough.</p>

              <p>I have read several articles lately about why you shouldn’t use NodeJS and all that. This might be relevant for business building their product on a language they don’t want to help work on themselves.</p>

<p>If you’re going to adopt a language like nodejs as your primary platform, you have to be willing to work through the bugs, help improve libraries as the language evolves, and maybe even contribute to the language itself.</p>

<p>LearnBoost is one company that I have seen making incredible contributions to the NodeJS community. They’ve developed the popular websocket library Socket.IO which I have been using lately. It was incredibly simple to setup, and voila! I have support for realtime communication from server to browser over WebSockets, Flash sockets, and 4 other fallback methods.</p>

<p>Companies like this will be the ones that push a language into stability and the mainstream. You might consider NodeJS to be in the same situation Rails was in the beginning. It’s a long ways to go, but if you are one of the early contributors building libraries and making a more robust language, you can gain some serious following and popularity.</p>

<p>I’m working on a web socket based IRC client in the browser. While I don’t have any knowledge of the internals of Node nor Socket.IO, I’m not scared about diving in and learning some things. It might take me a while to get situated, but I’m willing to start at the bottom and work my way up.</p>

<p>Sure working on a new language like Node can be daunting, but being so new, there is incredible excitement around it. There is also lots of criticism, but what language doesn’t have the same? Enough talk, it’s time to act.</p>

              <p>Something I keep forgetting about, is how Rails 3 treats gems. Any gem you want to use (in this case it was devise) needs to be setup in the Gemfile.</p>

<p>If you try to run Devise’s installation: <code>rails generate devise:install</code> you’ll get <code>Could not find generator devise:install</code>.</p>

<p>What happens is rails doesn’t detect that the devise gem is needed, and therefore doesn’t load it. All you’ve got to do is open the Gemfile for your project and add the following line, where the gem version matches what you are currently using:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'devise', '1.4.7'
</code></pre>

<p>Run the installation command again and you should be good to go!</p>
