              <p>Unless you’re born with a special skillset, it takes practice to be good at anything. It’s rare that we hear about all the time people invested in something before they became famous. You can be naturally good at something, but even still you need to work at it before you make your big break.</p>

<p>I see people all around me day in and day out doing things repeatedly. Whether it’s their job or a hobby, the continue to work at it, but they quickly forget that it takes hard work to become great. It can be demoralizing to realize just how long it might take you, but if you keep doing something, you’re bound to get better at it, even if by accident.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on <a href="http://keryxproject.org">Keryx</a> for 4 entire years just in my free time. I didn’t know any Python and barely knew how to program when I started. The only goal in my mind when I started was that I wanted to help make offline Linux a little easier for people. After releasing the first version, I knew it was crap. I redid it, that version lasted a lot longer. It was still crap. I spent hours thinking and planning on how I was going to improve it. This past summer I finally had the free time to sit down, rewrite it from scratch and apply all the things I have learned over the past 4 years. This time, it turned into something I’m actually quite proud of, and I even impressed myself a bit. There is still a lot I know that could be done better, but I never gave up even though so many times it just felt like an extra burden that I didn’t want to bother with. I was ready to just drop it several times. Sometimes I wanted to just go play video games and pretend the bug reports didn’t exist, but I knew that if I kept trying I would certainly get more out of it if I kept trying than if I just gave up. About 50,000 downloads later, I have to admit, all that time I spent was well worth it. I’ve met some really incredible people through working on it, and I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget a quitter, but it’s hard to ignore persistence. People give up constantly, their accomplishments are easily forgotten because they did not reach a goal they could be proud of. Many people try things for a little while, get bored when they realize they aren’t great and then move onto something else. Just don’t give up.</p>

<p>And don’t confuse pivoting with giving up. It’s often important to take a couple steps back, look at the situation from a different viewpoint and realize that maybe you were facing the wrong direction. The goal is still there, you were just looking at a mirage of what you thought the goal was.</p>

<p>Say you want to become a musician. You pick up an instrument and start playing. There’s something there, you really enjoy it, but something is missing. You start recording a mixing the audio on your computer and realize that what you <strong>really</strong> enjoy is DJ’ing. That’s not giving up on music, you still are doing something you love, it’s just another direction from what you set out for.</p>

<p>It’s easy to do a mediocre job at something. Anybody can do that. What’s tough is to have the persistence, determination, and commitment to continue doing something for <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4969415.ece">10,000 hours</a> until you are an expert. Those are the people who are remembered. Those are the people who are renowned. Those people persisted through all the tough practicing. That’s what you should strive for.</p>

              <p>Quite a while back I had the idea of doing a podcast. Of course, like everything else, the idea got tucked underneath a huge pile of papers in the filing cabinet you might call my brain. I’m happy to say that I’ve joined a podcast called Techie Trio with a couple of my friends <a href="http://twitter.com/oliverkrystal">Oliver Krystal</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/Gizmokid2005">Michael Secord</a>. Sure we might ramble and get lost in conversation a bit, it’s kind of a fun project (or should we call it experiment?) that we have all been working on. The Techie Trio homepage is over at  for anyone interested. <img src="http://excid3.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>Along with that, today I was put on trial for my good friend <a href="http://zachthibeau.com">Zach Thibeau’s podcast</a>. We talked about <a href="http://keryxproject.org">Keryx</a>, Linux, and some other random topics. Check it out if you’d like to hear a little background on Keryx, how it got started, over at:<a href="http://zachthibeau.com/blog.php/podcast-episode-2/"> http://zachthibeau.com/blog.php/podcast-episode-2/</a></p>

<p>It’s interesting to say that I have never met anyone of them in person, but we chat all the time online. Pretty cool to see what a little internet sprinkled on things can do. Or is it creepy? All in all I’d have to say I would have liked to get started doing podcasts a while ago. I’m sure I’m terrible at it, but given enough hours droning on and on about random tech, we should eventually be good at it right? o_O</p>

              <p>After excitedly picking up the Humble Indie Bundle 2 and finding out I got the original bundle AND they were Steam activatable, I was pretty stoked to install Steam and get started wasting away in the comfort of my computer chair as the sun set.</p>

<p>Just install steam and activate the games? Yeah right. I might as well have called Steam up to have them mail me a CD with the install files, my internet connection is terribly slow. Of course, I patiently download the installer, grab the updates and … what? Oh right, the updates get so far, restart, and then fail.</p>

<blockquote><p>Steam needs to be online to update. Please confirm your network connection and try again.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wat.</p>

<p>I’m online, it’s working fine, maybe it just timed out or something? I try this like 6 times. No dice. <img src="http://excid3.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" /></p>

<p>Back to the drawing board. I found a forum post that mentioned checking the Console.app for errors. Sure enough, it’s failing to download files. That’s weird.</p>

<p>Simple fix? Eh, it’s not too bad. Check your Console.app for the failing downloads, copy paste into your browser, download the files. Open up Applications Folder, Right click on Steam, click Show Package Contents, and paste the files Steam couldn’t get into the Contents/MacOS/package folder and try again.</p>

<p>The files I needed were the following if it might help anyone:
<a href="http://cdn.store.steampowered.com/public/client/public_all.zip.bdf97deae1c4a1de274011b11e0ac9f8336e1b6d">public_all.zip.bdf97deae1c4a1de274011b11e0ac9f8336e1b6d</a>
<a href="http://cdn.store.steampowered.com/public/client/webkit_osx.zip.98b47456b0de2d7e7f234f10649087f51cb53f1d">webkit_osx.zip.98b47456b0de2d7e7f234f10649087f51cb53f1d</a>
<a href="http://cdn.store.steampowered.com/public/client/bins_osx.zip.c142c18f1d54fa969d0f8dc50e6956560ffd9a25">bins_osx.zip.c142c18f1d54fa969d0f8dc50e6956560ffd9a25</a></p>

<p>Steam still had to grab 2MB of updates, but those seemed to work for some reason. This is on OSX 10.6.5 and I haven’t done anything weird with my installation. Don’t know what’s causing it, but whatever. This fixes it and now I get to forget about my bodily functions while I traverse time playing Braid until the wee hours of the morning…</p>
