              <p>A topic that came up in conversation recently was in regards to learning programming. We all come from different backgrounds which leads to everyone having a different view of everything.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting points I realized was something I vividly remember from my childhood. I was in 7th grade teaching myself how to program in GW-Basic. My father had given me an Atari programming book and I had set out to see what this was all about. I learned GW-Basic was almost the same thing, so it worked. I had to write my own line numbers and had nobody to ask questions.</p>

<p>The biggest project I thought I could accomplish at the time was a hangman game. It was going to be awesome. It would support colors, but because doing anything past 3 letter words would be complex, I decided to limit myself to just 3 letter words.</p>

<p>I started by writing out every 3 letter word I could possibly think of. I compiled this list and set out drawing the person on the screen. Everything worked well.</p>

<p>But the code was 35kb. It was an insane amount of code for basically nothing. What happened was that I wasn’t aware that you could reuse variables. I was a 7th grader so we hadn’t dove much into math. It didn’t even really click that programming was just math.</p>

<p>So here I had built a functional hangman game that supported every single 3 letter word there was. And yet, every single guess, every single failure, I was declaring a new variable.</p>

<p>When it comes to doing things like programming, always keep in mind that what’s obvious to you is not obvious to everyone else. Your knowledge is based upon your experience in life. You’re missing out on a lot of things other people have experienced, and they are missing out on things you’ve experienced. You’re no better than anybody else.</p>

<p>What’s obvious to you may not be obvious to someone else. When they <a href="http://excid3.com/blog/you-dont-truly-understand-it-until-you-think-its-obvious/" title="you don't truly understand it until you think it's obvious">feel something is completely obvious</a>, that means you’ve done your job.</p>

              <p class="date">Jul 03, 2012</p>
            </div><!--/.article-head-->
            <div class="article-content">
              <p>ActionMailer is pretty awesome. It does it’s job well, and as a Rails developer, you may be already familiar with it. Then you get tasked to build something that isn’t a Rails application. Using ActionMailer without Rails is easy, with a couple of gotchas.</p>

<h2>Setup Your Gemfile</h2>

<p>The first step, of course, is to add action mailer to your <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code>gem "actionmailer", "~&gt; 3.2.6", require: "action_mailer"
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect. Just run <code>bundle install</code> next and you’re off to the races.</p>

<h2>Create The Mailer</h2>

<p>Once you’ve got ActionMailer required, you can create a mailer just like before. I setup a directory just like Rails for <code>app/mailers</code> and created <code>mailer.rb</code> inside:</p>

<pre><code>class Mailer &lt; ActionMailer::Base
  default to: "chris@excid3.com"

  def notification(from_email)
    mail(from: from_email, subject: "New notification") do |format|
      format.text
      format.html
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The format block is what most people would be missing here. We can still render templates just like Rails does, but we have to specify the format(s) we want rendered. You can then create the <code>notification.text.erb</code> and <code>notification.html.erb</code> files in a views directory. I chose <code>app/views/mailers/notification.html.erb</code> for mine.</p>

<h3>Wiring It Up</h3>

<p>The last step is to configure ActionMailer to look for the proper folder for the views as well as configure your SMTP settings. I setup my project to have an initializers folder like Rails does. This just needs to be run on boot of your application:</p>

<pre><code>ActionMailer::Base.raise_delivery_errors = true
ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp
ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
   :address        =&gt; "smtp.gmail.com",
   :port           =&gt; 587,
   :domain         =&gt; "example.com",
   :authentication =&gt; :plain,
   :user_name      =&gt; "YOUR_EMAIL",
   :password       =&gt; "YOUR_PASSWORD",
   :enable_starttls_auto =&gt; true
  }
ActionMailer::Base.view_paths = File.expand_path('../../../app/views/', __FILE__)
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to modify the configuration settings here. The view_paths need to point to <code>app/views</code>. ActionMailer will append <code>mailer/notification.html.erb</code> to that path when looking for a template.</p>

<p>That should be all you need to do! The <code>format</code> block was the only part that had tripped me up with this so hopefully you have any easy time with this as well.</p>

              <p>As you live life, there are a lot of times when people need your help or you need theirs. Life is a game of learning and there are certainly some people better at it than others. Why is that and how can I become a better learner?</p>

<p>The most important thing I’ve noticed recently as I’ve been mentoring more people is that those who truly want to learn take a completely different approach when they ask for help.</p>

<p>Most of the time people come to me with something like:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey this isn’t working.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well good for you!</p>

<p>And then you get some people who go a bit further:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey this isn’t working. Do you know why?</p></blockquote>

<p>No I don’t, and you haven’t even told me why it’s not working.</p>

<p>Next, you’ve got people who come to you who are a bit further down the path:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey this isn’t working. It seems that X is broken but I don’t know what’s wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we’re onto something a bit better. At least I know what the issue is in regards to.</p>

<p>The best learners often come across as this last type:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey, so X isn’t working. It’s giving me error Y, and I was looking online about how to fix it. Someone suggested I do Z but it still fails after that. Can you take a look?</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah yes. Of course I can!</p>

<p>I’ve written before about <a href="http://excid3.com/blog/want-something-make-it-too-easy-to-say-yes/" title="make it easy to say yes">making it easy to say yes</a>. This is unbelievably important when you’re trying to learn.</p>

<p>My buddy <a href="http://8bitbomb.com/" title="James">James</a> has been learning Rails recently. He’s got tons of questions, but it’s been a joy to help him through it because when he has a question, he brings everything to the table. He knows what he wants to accomplish and, best of all, he’s already attempted a solution and is looking for ways to finish or improve it. And after only a couple weeks of some fairly minor help, his learning ability has brought his skills from asking lots of questions, to explaining the problem to me, and figuring it out on his own most of the time.</p>

<p>Just think about that, <strong>a couple weeks of determination can bring you further than most people can do in 6 months.</strong></p>

<p>Having an open mind about solving problems is the best way to be. Most people who are afraid of annoying someone by asking too many questions are afraid of this because they aren’t really letting you help them.</p>

<p>I know I haven’t always had this mindset either. Taking Chemistry classes in college, english in highschool, and many other situations, I shut myself off mentally from learning these topics as much as I would have liked. All I had to do was embrace things and <strong>TRY</strong>. And the funny thing is, you’ll quickly realize you don’t even have to try hard! If you actually care, you’ve immediately done more than 80% of people. You just have to try.</p>

<p>Live life with an open mind. Try new things, ask questions, and learn. It’s incredible what you can do when you really open yourself up.</p>
