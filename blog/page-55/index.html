              <p>One project I have been working on lately has to do with Python and OpenGL rendering on a cluster of computers. The pyopengl project has documentation on things, but it’s not much more than API docs. That may be fine for some, but I’m completely new to OpenGL and need some actual tutorials and example code to get myself started.</p>

<p>The first thing I needed to get working properly was rendering to dual monitors. That should be extremely easy right? Yeah, if you can find examples. Let’s step through this example:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys

from OpenGL.GL import *
from OpenGL.GLUT import *


def main():

    # Initialize OpenGL
    glutInit(sys.argv)
    glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGB)

    # Configure the display output
    glutGameModeString("2560x1024:24@60")
    glutEnterGameMode()

    # Setup callbacks
    glutKeyboardFunc(keyboard)
    glutDisplayFunc(display)

    # Begin!
    glutMainLoop()


def keyboard(key, x, y):
    if key == 'q':
        sys.exit(0)


def display():

    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)

    glBegin(GL_LINES)
    glVertex2f(1.0, 1.0)
    glVertex2f(-1.0, -1.0)
    glEnd()

    glutSwapBuffers()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s start with the <code>main()</code> function. The first two <code>glutInit</code> calls setup glut. The first initializes glut with any command line arguments that might have been passed. The second sets up glut to render using a double buffer for smoothness and using RGB for colors. Pretty simple.</p>

<p>Next up we have <code>glutGameModeString</code>. You might recognize the format slightly. First you have your resolution, your color bits, and then your monitor refresh rate. Quite straight forward and easy.</p>

<p>Note that GameMode is the only way you can render to dual monitors with <code>glut</code>. Typically you see <code>glutFullScreen</code> but this will only fullscreen on a single monitor. You could code dual monitor support yourself, but GameMode takes care of it for you.</p>

<p>All we do is configure GameMode, and then enter it. Simple as that. There is one serious catch however. Since GameMode takes control of your screen…it captures your inputs too. There is no escape! Your mouse and keyboard get captured and then you’re stuck.</p>

<p>To combat this, we simply add a keyboard function. When the ‘q’ key is pressed, we exit the program. Using this with <code>sys.exit</code> may not be the greatest way to exit, but <code>glut</code> does not provide a method of leaving the MainLoop. You might try throwing an exception if need be.</p>

<p>The display function is pretty simple, and you can find lots of examples on how to draw. I won’t go into any detail with the display function since it is going to look vastly different between applications.</p>

<p>That’s the basics for running GameMode on dual monitors. In the future, I’ll likely cover some more topics regarding PyOpenGL and as always, I’m open to suggestions if you would like me to check out a specific topic. <img src="http://excid3.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" /></p>

              <p>We’ve all had those days where we just wanted to lounge around, grab a quart of ice cream, kick on a movie and forget about the 6.73 million tasks that need to be done in the next half hour. Sure it makes you want to perform an act of violence to get people off your back, but works gotta be done. For most of us, it’s work we don’t even want to do too. That makes it just that much worse.</p>

<p>So how do you find motivation? The same approach won’t work for everyone, but  I have figured out what works for me. I’ve tried a lot of different things and a lot of them can work now and again, but it takes time till you can figure out what works for you time and time again.</p>

<p>For me being a lowly developer and soon to be college graduate, it surprisingly doesn’t take too much to motivate me.</p>

<p><strong>Listening to a podcast</strong></p>

<p>Nothing really motivates me as much as this. Listening to real people talk about their accomplishments makes me think, why haven’t I done something awesome like that yet? I tend to look at people who are “accomplished” and I get this fire inside me that says “hey, I could do that! Why am I not doing that right now?” and off I go.</p>

<p>This also goes a long ways for the times when I need some background noise while I work. Kick on a podcast while you are deep in the trenches forging your web applications of the future and maybe you’ll pick up some tips along the way.</p>

<p>The other day I was feeling terribly unmotivated and severely needed to do something about it. Being home from break, my family was just about to go to bed, and I was going to do the same. Since the sun wasn’t rising yet, it was too early for such a college student to consider going to bed yet, but that’s what I was going to do. I layed down, put in some headphones and began listening to an episode of <a href="http://techzinglive.com">TechZing!</a> (one of my all time favorite podcasts). Droopy eyelids, pajamas, warm blanket, and a dimly lit room, it was certain I would just push off everything till the morning. It was literally no more than 15 seconds of hearing their voices discuss startups that my eyes were wide open, my brain was full of ideas, and I was more awake than I had been the entire day. Not wanting to waste the moment, I got up, sat down at my computer, lost all track of time and what do you know, the sun rose and someone’s alarm went off signaling that for my own health’s sake, I should take that as a reminder that I need sleep to survive.</p>

<p><strong>Reading</strong></p>

<p>My second most useful resource of motivation is simply reading about other people’s accomplishments. Since the great thing about podcasts are that you can listen to them while you’re doing other things, reading doesn’t keep me perpetually motivated, but it sure can get the ball rolling.</p>

<p>Sit down, fire up Google Reader where I’ve got Hacker News articles and several other blogs of incredibly interesting posts, I can easily filter through, find something impressive, and be on my merry way. It doesn’t take much sometimes to hear, wow, this guy built a startup in a weekend and is making money already? I’m a poor college student, why something like that would be incur a serious dent in the loans and debt that just perpetually builds up over your college experience.</p>

<p>Grab a blog article, a book like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446563048?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrioliv-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0446563048">Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chrioliv-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0446563048" alt="" /> (a personal favorite of mine I highly recommend), or whatever and find someone who has done things you might have dreamed of doing.</p>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes you need to relax for a bit but still would like to feel motivated soon. What better way than to sit down and watch a <a href="http://ted.com">TED talk</a> or an inspirational movie like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/">Gattaca</a>. Relax for a bit while you watch and then afterwards you just have this sensation of changing the world.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>To find motivation, the goal is simple. Find someone’s accomplish that impresses you. There will always be someone out there who is better than you, so use that to your advantage.</p>

<p>Just relax and think to yourself “I wanna be the very best like no one ever was.” I admit, ending with a quote from the Pokemon theme was probably a bad choice, but hey, its related right?</p>

              <p>I’ll be the first to admit that I’m no god with Rails development. I know the basics, and I can get things done relatively quickly, but a lot of my experience is editing other people’s apps. Feeling like I was missing out on a lot of the underlying things, I figured it was a good idea to create an app which I (and hopefully others) would use daily.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever used Google Tasks, you’ll nod in agreement when I say that it’s pretty crappy. Living without a todo list is kind of hard, but I haven’t found anything I liked too much yet either. What do I do? Might as well build my own and learn some Rails and Ajax while I’m doing it.</p>

<p>Introducing: <strong>Fluttr</strong></p>

<p>I learned some Ajax, some Rails, and got it all done in under 4 hours (including time to learn what I wasn’t familiar with). Not too shabby, and I enjoyed it a lot. It’s open source for anyone interested in running their own copy or adding their own features.</p>
