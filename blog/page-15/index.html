              <p>Avid gamers can relate to the joy of leveling up. It means you have new powers. You can do incredible new things. Everything you’ve done in the past would be easy if you could do it over again.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this feels like it only happens in video games. But I don’t think it actually does. I leveled up last week.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I would consider myself decent at my craft. I can build just about anything you can describe and it will work. I can design the architecture, implement it, and get it working reliably.</p>

<p>I saw myself at somewhat of a standstill. I can build whatever you want, but I still don’t like how my code works necessarily, and I know there is tons more to learn.</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes the biggest problem is that you know there is more to learn, but you have no idea where to start.</strong></p>

<p>My main goal lately has been learning how to do code testing extremely well. But this is very hard when your code is ad hoc like mine was.</p>

<p>University courses explain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" title="Class (Computer Programming)">classes</a> in programming as objects. The first example is usually something like a VCR has these functionalities: play, pause, rewind. This helps you understand the concept of classes in programming, but in doing so, it limited my understanding of them considerably.</p>

<p>After watching <a href="http://destroyallsoftware.com" title="Destroy All Software">Destroy All Software</a>, I realized classes should be used to contain an idea. You can break up the internals of a VCR into logical pieces, and each of those could also be it’s own class. And if you do that, you can write tests for each individual piece, so when all put together, you know the VCR will work. You should trust that the internals will work first, before putting them together to make a larger product like a VCR.</p>

<p>This just simply clicked for me the other day watching these videos. I had a moment of clarity and truly understood things on another level.</p>

<p>Everything I’ve ever built before is now moot. I can shoot holes through all my existing work in seconds, but that’s a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>I leveled up in real life.</strong></p>

<p>Learning is a long journey, and we often hit these plateaus like I did. It’s hard to get through them. Sometimes you get frustrated and give up. Sometimes you keep on going and hit a gold mine.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a plateau, start talking to people and listening to anyone you look up to. They did something cool? Absorb it like a sponge.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t completely understand their advice, try applying it anyways. It might just be that you simply need to change your mental frame of reference.</p>

              <p>One of the most intriguing posts I’ve read in a while has to be <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3225-what-are-questions" title="What are questions?">What are questions?</a> on the 37signals Signal Vs Noise blog. There was a quote of Clay Christensen in it where he says the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Paraphrased slightly, he said: “Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to ask the question – you have to want to know – in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is <strong>beautifully</strong> said.</p>

<p>I got thinking about it and it applies to so many experiences I’ve had in the past. It’s incredible how we shut ourselves off without questions.</p>

<p>If I want a yes or no answer to a question, I will not care if you sit and explain why the answer is yes. Why? Because I’ve only opened up my mind enough for a simple answer. I’ve seen this with over and over again with students in college. They ask questions, but it’s simple and direct. “Will this be on the exam?” If the answer is yes, they have more questions, and their space for answers expands. They instantly care more. “Well what about this will be on the exam?” “How will the question be asked?” “What is the answer?” On the other hand, if the answer was “No, this will not be on the exam”, we accept that, and leave no more room for learning.</p>

<p>And how do I know this? Because that was my approach exactly throughout most of school. If I didn’t find it intriguing of it’s own accord, I would use this to determine whether or not I should remember more about it.</p>

<p>Yet, with programming, I don’t know that I’ve felt that way often. I’m like a damn sponge when it comes to programming. Seeing anything, I want to learn how it works. I’m immediately filled with questions and that’s helps me learn these topics.</p>

<p><strong>Find things that make <em>you</em> a sponge.</strong></p>

              <p>In conversation recently, one of my favorite childhood stories came up and I thought it was very fitting to share:</p>

<h2>The Napkin</h2>

<p>Back when my friend was 5, his family was eating at this fancy restaurant. As a 5 year old, it’s hard to sit still so he got bored sitting and not really understanding what was going on. So he began to play around with the things he had in front of him. Very quickly saw the perfect opportunity to turn the napkin he had into a hat.</p>

<p>His mother began to trying to calm him down and lecture him. “You don’t see anyone else in this restaurant wearing a napkin on their head.”</p>

<p>Little did she know, but a neighboring table had been overhearing and watching everything. One of the people at the table decided it would be good idea to put a napkin on his head to encourage my friend’s mischief. So now there is both a 5 year old and an adult wearing napkins on their heads in this fancy restaurant.</p>

<p>As my friend and his mother began looking around to see if she was right, they see this guy. “What about him?!” my friend exclaimed, leaving his mother embarrassed and now completely unable to explain why this wasn’t acceptable to do in a fancy restaurant.</p>

<h2>A Little Weirdness Is What You Need</h2>

<p>I’ve realized how memorable something can be if you do things a little unorthodox. I’ll never forget this story and I will always look for opportunities to be that random stranger to someone else.</p>

<p>No matter what you’re doing, whether it’s hanging out with friends, working, or spending time on a hobby, the most memorable things are usually something that was a little weird.</p>

<p>Do something that’s a little odd. Github didn’t <em>have</em> to make <a href="http://octodex.github.com">all these Octocats</a>, but it’s one of those things that makes me love them just that much more because it’s different.</p>

<p>Weirdness like this should be celebrated and encouraged. It’s harmless and puts a smile on someone’s face. It gets them to think outside of the ordinary for a moment and that’s rare. <strong>People appreciate that.</strong></p>

<p>This can be great for marketing, and if you’re good at what you do AND you can market yourself, <a href="http://talsraviv.com/2012/07/26/being-a-developer-makes-you-valuable.-learning-how-to-market-makes-you-dangerous/">you become dangerous</a>.</p>

<p>For me on a personal level, I’m sometimes known as <a href="http://excid3.dropmark.com/28945">the guy that has an animated gif for every situation</a>.</p>

<p>Pick something you enjoy and make it <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>

<p>With all that said…</p>
