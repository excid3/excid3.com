              <p>You want the short answer? <strong>Appeal to a person’s wants.</strong></p>

<p>We’re all human. Everyone has a huge list of wants. Some of them might be more immediate than others. Some of you may want to new customers, some of you want help on homework, or maybe you want help moving with a friend’s help.</p>

<p>Let’s take the business example. Say you run a credit card company and are looking to get new customers. What should you do? You’ve seen it a thousand times. Send “pre-approved” credit cards to potential customers appealing to them with lower interest rates than competitors. But what’s special about this? The credit cards are literally a signature away from being your new customer.</p>

<p>You have to appeal to people’s wants. In this case, you’re appealing to not only to the financial side of a person’s intuition but you’re also subtly telling them that you’re going to make things easy as a customer. You didn’t force them to do hardly anything to sign up, so they get the reassurance that the rest of their experience with you will be the same.</p>

<blockquote><p>“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” – Antoine de Saint-Exupery</p></blockquote>

<p>Get them excited about helping you and they will come willingly.</p>

<p>If a customer is unsure of your service, offer a free trial. You can allow them to use your product for free, invest time into using it, and when they reach a limit all they’ve got to do is put in their credit card information. The flip side is you can ask for their information up front and give them 30 days to cancel. If you get them to register in the first place, it will be too easy for them to stay on as a fulltime customer.</p>

<p>Want help moving? Buy them dinner or help them with something they’ve been wanting to do. Get them excited, take them to that restaurant they’ve always wanted to go to, or help them finish their model airplane. After you’ve aligned interests, have gloves, hand carts, and lemonade ready for when they show up to help you move.</p>

<p>Students who show that they’ve actually tried working on the problems make it easy for you to help them because what they need is specific. Anytime a student asks “I need help?” and they’re not specific it feels like they’re just asking for you to do the homework for them. This puts the burden on the person helping to figure out what the student needs help on, if they really want to learn it, if they just want hte answer, among other things. When the student needs help with one specific thing it’s easy for you to say okay, I’ll help.</p>

<p>Make it easy for people to give what you want and they will do so. It doesn’t take much sometimes but you’ve got look at it from their eyes.</p>

              <p>Love or hate the apple fanboys, they’re the ones who keep coming back every year for the latest hardware revision. What’s that, a new screen? OMGWTFBBQ. Gotta have it. They send your company’s praises constantly to family, friends, and strangers.</p>

<p>These are the people who will be with you through the hard times. These are the customers you want for your business. But how do you get them?</p>

<p>Let me give you an example. I read about <a href="https://www.cottonbot.com/">CottonBot</a> the other day on Hacker News. Put simply, it’s a side project by Muzzammil Zaveri and Ethan Fast. I wasn’t aware of it, but Startup Schwag had shut down, but the basic premise is that you can subscribe and get cool startup schwag each month.</p>

<p>After checking out their idea, I loved the idea, disliked the price, and was unsure whether I’d like all the shirt designs they would release. I figured I’d send them an email with a couple questions too see if I’d get a response.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6TrIh8PKZIw/ToiFIsyHvzI/AAAAAAAABJA/jnhJaWjZmMA/s720/IMG_20111002_103615.jpg" title="Cottonbot Stripe Tshirt" alt="" />Would you look at that. They got back to me in a couple days, had lowered the price, and had noticed me talking about the Stripe tshirt on Twitter and offered to send me one for free!</p>

<p>That sold me right then and there. They cared, and I trusted they would do a good job. I received a hand written thank you and the tshirt in the mail yesterday. I’ll be a fanboy for life.</p>

<p>It didn’t take much, they didn’t even need to send me a tshirt to gain my trust. All they did was listen and show me some respect. It’s more than you get from most businesses, even when you’re talking in person with someone.</p>

<p>Simple customer service can turn an unsure customer into a fanboy with a simple email. They are more likely to be understanding when you have to raise prices. Netflix could have used this tactic when they raised theirs. Without customers you have nothing. Never forget that.</p>

              <p>Yaml is awesome. One of the ruby parsers Yaml is named Syck. It’s awesome, but most of the time you’re not dealing with it directly. You install a gem and get an error regarding Syck, but its just a dependency of one of the gems.</p>

<p>In my case it was:</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `write' for #
</code></pre>

<p>The quick solution to this is to set your RUBYOPT environment variable:</p>

<pre><code>RUBYOPT='-rpsych' bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>The reason behind this is that YAML automatically uses the older Syck library unless Psych is loaded before YAML.</p>
