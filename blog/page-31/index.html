              <p>We use iChat a lot here at work. It’s nice for screen sharing and audio/video chat. The problem with it is that sometimes you’ll sign on and it just won’t work. You either can’t set your status to available or you don’t have any buddies listed. It’s annoying to say the least.</p>

<p>The solution for this is to open up Activity Monitor and quit the <code>imagent</code> process like so:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2H1I3m2z1k0P1x2e0Y3Q/Screen%20Shot%202011-11-21%20at%202.41.42%20PM.png" alt="Activity Monitor" /></p>

<p>Then you should be able to restart iChat and be good to go. This seems to stem from sleeping OSX often. So maybe you should just do a full shutdown at the end of the work day once in a while. <img src="http://excid3.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" /></p>

              <p>A few weeks ago, I decided that I would write more. I’ve always liked writing but I rarely did.</p>

<p>I know I’m not the only one that feels like this, but finishing things is hard. We start hundreds of projects, only to get started and then never complete them.</p>

<p>For me, I wanted to write more blog posts. I decided that every week I would post something. After a while, step it up a notch and write something twice a week. Things were great. I had stuck to my goal well for quite a while.</p>

<p>Monday I didn’t have a blog post ready to go out. I missed my deadline. It was a personal deadline so it didn’t really matter. Right? That’s what I told myself.</p>

<p>Hell no. It mattered a lot. I sat there thinking about it the next day. Am I really going to just let it end like that? I thought about not writing at all this week because it was so easy just skip writing and do something unproductive.</p>

<p>What a terrible thought.</p>

<p>I just about gave up writing then and there. It was hard to find time. It was hard to find ideas. Things got tough and I said whatever, maybe later.</p>

<p>If you really want to get better at something don’t give up. Fight through the hard times. It might take a long time, but you will get there. People might say you’re terrible at it. People might laugh at you. Who cares? It’s your life, not theirs.</p>

<p>Just don’t give up. Finish what you set out to do.</p>

              <p>Derek Sivers has been a role model to me for I don’t know how long. His outlook on the world is very similar to mine and reading his recent blog post <a href="http://sivers.org/232">232 sand dollars</a> I realized just how much this is true.</p>

<p>His post is about collection unbroken sand dollars on the beach. As a kid, I remember looking for them myself only to realize shortly afterwards that they didn’t really bring value to me themselves. It was the search that was the excitement.</p>

<p>Why do I like business? Because trying to figure out what gets people to spend money is an incredibly challenging game. Most people only ever work for someone else. They do their portion of the business and that’s it. For me, it’s not about the money, it’s about figuring out how people tick. It’s fascinating.</p>

<p>Having lots of money isn’t exciting. In fact, if you read about it, most people say having <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIyzG8i7Kg0&amp;feature=related">more money brings more problems</a>. The excitement is easy to misinterpret. What’s exciting about Christmas? Not knowing what you’re going to unwrap. Give it a few days, and you won’t be excited anymore.</p>

<p><strong>The excitement comes from not knowing.</strong></p>

<p>If you don’t understand something, it appears magical. Human nature makes you want to figure it out.</p>

<p>Next time you catch yourself wanting something material, take a moment to think if you really want it. Do you actually want it, or is it just fun to think about acquiring it?</p>
