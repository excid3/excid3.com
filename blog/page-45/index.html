              <p><img src="http://excid3.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/rails.png" title="rails" alt="" />As a huge Rails fan, I was extremely pumped to see that Rails 3.1 beta 1 was released today. What does this mean for our favorite web framework? A couple things, overall good, but you have to be accepting of the Rails way.</p>

<h2>JQuery</h2>

<p>This is, of course, probably the most welcomed change in Rails 3.1. I know just as a small time developer most of the projects I work on have switched to using JQuery for its popularity. There are a plethora of external libraries out there for it and is simply more common than the other frameworks out there. This is an excellent move.</p>

<h2>CoffeeScript</h2>

<p>Another incredibly welcomed addition to Rails 3.1 is CoffeeScript. As many people have come to realize, Javascript is often very unclean and illogical. CoffeeScript’s aim is to clear this up while providing a lot of syntactic sugar. It removes a lot of the idiosyncrasies while providing a much more readable format. It, of course, is not without it’s opponents. You’re learning something that isn’t really Javascript, but it’s certainly better than trying to debug RJS.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9f09aeb8273177fc2d09ebdafcc76ee8eb56fe33">Github commit</a> that included CoffeeScript has a very funny and controversial set of comments that you should definitely check out for a good laugh.</p>

<h2>Sass</h2>

<p>OMG. Sass. If you haven’t used this yet, you’re missing out. It’s CSS with variables, functions, nesting, and more. What more is there to say? It’s just plain awesome. You can still write your css as normal, but now you’ve got a whole set of tools to make your life easier.</p>

<h2>Nice! But what about HAML?</h2>

<p>Yeah, you noticed it was missing too. So I’m sure that I’m not the only one, but I just don’t like HAML. It feels weird. Unlike CoffeeScript and Sass, with HAML you’re not really improving the underlying code. You’re simply abstracting it and giving it a more pleasing look. There’s no actual features that it adds and I think this is where most people feel uncomfortable using it. To me it just feels dirty. Sure it looks much better, but there really isn’t a whole lot of benefit I gain from it. Some things it doesn’t support and that’s enough for me to have a bad taste in my mouth. <a href="http://intridea.com/2011/5/4/i-heart-sass-but-haml-im-just-not-that-in-to-you">I’m not the only one.</a> That’s not to say it’s bad to use, it’s just not my thing.</p>

<p>So that’s the main changes in Rails 3.1. I think it’s a great move forward and, while forcing me to learn a few more languages, it’s an important movement. Rails has always been a well curated group of tools. This is just another iteration as the tools continue to grow and improve along with the community.</p>

<p>I know I’m going to be sure to start any new projects with Rails 3.1 and hope that I can contribute patches into Rails core as I go.</p>

              <h2 class="title"><a href="/blog/failure-is-a-good-thing" class="js-pjax">Failure is a good thing</a></h2>

            <div class="article-content">
              <p>It certainly may not seem like it at first, but failure is a good thing. That’s how you grow and learn.</p>

<p>What’s worse than failure, though, is mediocrity.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Failure lets you move on, mediocrity stalls you and keeps you from reaching your potential</strong>. <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/47646/Insight-From-Dropbox-Failure-Is-Not-The-Worst-Outcome-Mediocrity-Is.aspx?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:%20onstartups%20(OnStartups)">#</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t put it better myself. If things are mediocre, you’ll may always have a feeling that things will improve but it never happens. You are stuck in a limbo. Nothing is improving and nothing is failing. You don’t know what to do so you just keep going at it.</p>

<p>At least with failure you have closure. It’s a good sign that it is time to move on and you can accept that. Like Dan Gilbert discusses in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400042666">Stumbling Upon Happiness</a>, when things are really bad, our brains figure out a way to look at the situation and find something good out of it. This applies to failure in anything. <strong>It’s devastating to realize, but you know this means you can go try something new and maybe focus on something you love more this time around.</strong> Most people want to improve things, so failure becomes a moment of realization which you can make a vow to yourself to try harder, do something different, become that person you wish you were.</p>

<p>Failure helps you realize things, but that’s not to say being mediocre isn’t bad. You can often sell a decent company for a good chunk of change. Sure that’s a completely valid argument against embracing failure, but as humans, we are terrible predictors of the future. Who is to say your next idea won’t be the one that changes the world? <strong>Wouldn’t you rather be doing something awesome?</strong> The time you’re spending on this mediocre startup or project could be much better spent elsewhere. You won’t know until something happens (failure) that causes you to make a change.</p>

<p>Don’t fall into fear of rejection and failure. It’s not so bad. It builds up that people will remember you for your failures but guess what? They won’t. How many failed companies do you remember? Probably not too many. The first ones you think of are probably success and then you try to remember  ones in the same space that failed. It’s not easy to do because nobody really cares about your failures. <strong>What you’re successful at is what people will remember.</strong></p>
