              <p>“Is it worth it?” is a question that comes up a lot. And when I say that, I mean, this happens every single time you purchase something.</p>

<p>Now to me, this is a simple choice. And it’s usually not about how much things cost either. For example, last year I wanted to get more exercise and improve my lifestyle and to do that I wanted to start cycling again. Always loved it as a child so it was something I knew I would enjoy again. I had plenty of bicycles to choose from in the shed. They all squeaked, were rusty, but all-in-all just fine. But I knew that in order for <strong>ME</strong> to not give up after a few weeks I would have to own a bike that didn’t cause me any trouble. I decided to buy a brand new bike and have ridden far more than I could have imagined when I was starting out. I have ridden hundreds of miles, found a wonderful new (and healthy!) hobby for me and I absolutely love it.</p>

<p><strong>Subtle frustrations can cause me to give up on things without realizing it.</strong> This doesn’t even apply to your personal life either. It most definitely applies to work as well. My current job consists of developing websites on the ever-more-popular Rails framework. But even with it’s enormous popularity, learning Rails was a huge pain. At first, I just figured it was because I was unfamiliar with the tools, linux, and the codebase. Then I saw my coworker setup our site on OSX in under 2 hours, which took me 3 weeks to get partially working on Ubuntu. Wow. I went and purchased a macbook that same day and haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>If you want to change something (be that yourself or the world), make sure you take a second to consider what is important to you. For me, when I want to make a change to my life, unless its forced upon me, it won’t be permanent unless I enjoy it. Riding a nice bike, working on a nice computer, whatever it is, you must enjoy it if you want it to stick. Dieting doesn’t work because you’re always conscious of this overhead of what you can and can’t have every time you eat. If you switch to being vegetarian and actually love vegetables, it’s not hard to stay that way.</p>

<p>You don’t need to give up what you love to make a change. Just find something new that you didn’t realize you loved that helps make that change.</p>

              <p>When you’ve got an idea, most times, you want to start hacking out at it immediately. Then after years of experience doing this as a child, you come to the realization that for more complex problems, you need to sit down, plan everything out, and then implement.</p>

<p>There are times when you could spend days, weeks, and months planning. You could always get a little bit more research before deciding upon the potentially best implementation. Well guess what? You just wasted a bunch of time that you could have been public, getting feedback, iterating, and becoming generally more awesome. Who knows, maybe you spent too much time and someone beat you, or you ran out of money and now you’re really stuck.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, you’ll hear this advice a lot. Just go do it. Certainly my favorite, most motivating article has to be <a href="http://inoveryourhead.net/maybe-you-should-just-stop-being-a-fucking-pussy/">this one</a>. Every time I read it I’m so incredibly pumped to get started, I can barely finish what I’m supposed to be doing that day. I just want to start working on my side project and get it off the ground.</p>

<p>That advice is all fine and dandy. It’s very motivating and will honestly help you get things accomplished. But take it with a grain of salt too. Several articles I have read recently (I’ll link to them if I can remember what they were…) emphasized this advice in a manner that was more like “Go do it and ignore everything else.”</p>

<p>Well you certainly could do that, but don’t you think a <em>little</em> planning would be useful? Don’t start without a plan, but don’t prematurely optimize either. I know personally I have taken the naive approach of just jumping ship to try something. Every time I had to rewrite it at least once. This will happen with anything, but I know that I could have saved myself a lot of frustration had I taken a day or two more to look at the problem before attacking.</p>

<p>Know your exact goal before you take the plunge, but don’t wait too long.</p>

              <p class="date">Apr 11, 2011</p>

            <div class="article-content">
              <p>There’s no reason you have to graduate school without a job lined up. A sweet job at that. You don’t have to accept the fact that unemployment is so high and that there is a good chance you won’t find a job in the next 6 months. Nope. <strong>That doesn’t apply to you at all.</strong></p>

<p>You want to know why? <strong>Because you’re spending your time creating and building cool things of value.</strong></p>

<p>It doesn’t matter what career path you’re taking. It doesn’t matter what you want to do. You just need to build value. For programmers, build some tools that simplify your life. Release it open source on github. Get people using it. You can build things no matter what career path you’re going down.</p>

<p>If you don’t know what to build, start a blog. Write about topics relevant to your interests and career. Gain popularity. <strong>Promote, promote, promote.</strong></p>

<p>Keep active with the community you build. Reach out to strangers. Use Twitter, Facebook, and any other social network that applies to you. Meet people, make friends, and do it just because you want to. Do it in your free time well before you’re looking to apply for jobs.</p>

<p>You’ll have built up a reputation, impressed people, and have a network you can leverage to find yourself that job that is looking for <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>

<p>Okay, but does this actually work? You betcha. In fact, it sometimes works well. You might end up getting overwhelmed by offers.</p>

<p>I started working on <a href="http://keryxproject.org">Keryx</a> as a freshman in college. My goal was to create a tool to make it easy for offline Linux users to easily update offline machines. I didn’t create it with the intention of people knowing my name. I created it because I wanted to give back something of value back to the Ubuntu community. It worked. 4 years and a lot of versions later, I’ve clocked nearly 60,000 downloads <strong>and that’s for a tool whose users have no internet.</strong></p>

<p>Marketing for Keryx was suggesting it on forums, blogs, and communities. <strong>For the first couple months</strong>. Nothing more. I stopped promoting it to work on improving it. Things just snowballed. Sure it still needs a LOT of work, but I created it to learn and give back to the community. I achieved both of those goals 1000 times over.</p>

<p>This takes time, and you may get burnt out working on the same thing, so create side projects as well. I have a whole slew of things on <a href="http://github.com/excid3">my github account</a>. Keep pushing yourself and before you know it, you’ll have some awesome contributions to talk about during interviews.</p>

<p>As if the sincere, heartfelt thank you letters for building something so dear to a person’s problem of helping to spread Linux wasn’t motivating enough, you’ll have lots of people contacting you for help. Every time you can help someone, do so. <strong>It is great to become the go-to guy for your domain’s questions, but an even greater feeling to have actually made a difference in someone’s life.</strong></p>

<p>After all that hard work, guess what you have? Amazing topics to discuss during interviews. You can show them your passion for not only your career, but that you will be someone that they don’t even need to interview to determine your skills. <strong>Why? Because they already admire you.</strong></p>

<p>Now go. Go stack that cheddar.</p>
