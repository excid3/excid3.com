              <p>So recently I have been working on download scripts for Keryx once again. Building a script to do this seemed over my head at first. The plethora of classes and functions was a little daunting at first, but realizing how to use them after reading some examples wasn’t so bad. Urlgrabber seems to do the trick, but I have run into some issues. Why not rewrite it from scratch and learn something along the way?</p>

<p>I had two goals in mind. #1 was providing resume support. This is the most important thing we have been missing in Keryx for a while. We were able to do it with urlgrabber but I did not feel like wading through all the code to learn how it worked and make changes. #2 was file progess. This proved to be a problem with urlgrabber such that some of the output would overlap or be skewed improperly.</p>

<p>In the end, this is what I came up with. It’s essentially a modified version of this code example:</p>

<p>I cleaned up some of the variable names to make things a little clearer and even though it is still quite ugly. Beautification is for another night though.</p>

              <p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted and the reason for posting was none to thrilling. Installing Ubuntu 10.04 on my primary desktop, I only realized after the fact that the partition I chose to format for the new install was my home directory from the previous install. I guess I was just a little bit too anxious. <img src="http://excid3.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" /> Not losing anything too important thanks to Dropbox and my massive media partition, I decided it was important that from now on I keep remote backups of my home directory. Repurposing my old laptop whose video card has been flaky seemed like the perfect choice so I fired up Ubuntu 8.04 desktop on that machine and configured its secondary hard drive to be for backups only. I followed this nifty tutorial here: . The only modifications I had made were in the cron script which I put $LPATH before $RPATH because rsync takes SRC and then DEST as parameters in that order making the script run improperly. Using a static IP for the server laptop on my router guarantees that as long as the box is up and running, I’ll have a nightly backup of everything in my home directory.</p>

              <p>Tonight I was fiddling around with my LAN and wanted to get samba running on my desktop’s Ubuntu Karmic 64bit installation so that I could watch <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/">This Week In Startups</a> (best show ever btw) and listen to music on my laptops without having to copy files over. So, I fire up Keryx 1.0 pre-alpha on my work laptop and start to download the packages for samba. 4 packages, sounded right, exactly what APT wanted too. Installation went without a hitch, but when trying to share my media folder, I got an issue with something called “testparm”. Having no idea what this was, nor how to fix it, I figured I’d take a stab at it before googling. Sure enough, testparm is an application in samba-common-bin that was not installed as part of the required service. Makes a lot of sense right? Not at all. So basically, if you’ve got this issue, just install the samba-common-bin package and you’re good to go. Hopefully that gets added as a dependency soon and the issue wrapped up.</p>
