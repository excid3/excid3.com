              <blockquote><p>I finished this programming book and I still don't feel like a
real programmer. What do I do next?</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a question that I get asked a lot having been involved in <a href="http://launchcodestl.com">LaunchCode STL</a>. There are a million things to learn, but we all have to start somewhere. Most people start with a book that takes them so far and then drops you off in the middle of nowhere when you're finished.</p>

<p>The answer to that is actually remarkably simple: <strong>I tell people to build software they would use.</strong></p>

<p>Most people seem to mistake this advice for something that it's not. I typically start hearing ideas for software they wish they had. Things that don't exist. <em>But you don't have to build something new.</em> Of course that is your goal but that is not what I told you to build.</p>

<p><strong>To clarify, I'm saying that you should build your own version of the software you use every day.</strong></p>

<p>Do you use url shorteners like <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a> or Twitter's <a href="http://t.co">t.co</a>? Build your own.</p>

<p>Have you ever used a pastebin like like <a href="http://pastebin.com">pastebin.com</a>? Build your version.</p>

<p>It is up to you to fill the gaps. For me, I wanted to become an expert
web developer so I sat down and built my own web server. I built a Java
app that listened to port 80 and served up files just like Apache or
Nginx would do. The time I spent building this app was filled with
acquiring such deep understanding of the web that I could not have
gained any other way so quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Build something without the help of any libraries and you <em>will</em> learn programming.</strong> You have to in order to complete the project and guess what? It is stuff you use every day so you know <em>exactly</em> how it should work.</p>

<p>You have the best understanding of how this software functions so replicating it on your own means that you can understand the ins and outs of it without the overhead. There are no requirements to deal with. You get to purely focus on the art of programming and that's it. This is what you're trying to do right now.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So if you are teaching yourself programming, take a step back for a second and look at all the software you use on a daily basis. That is a whole lot of stuff to take for granted.</p>

<p>Everything from your web browser down to the operating system and boot loader. Every single piece was designed and written by a software developer that probably isn't smarter than you, they just had experience.</p>

<p>You want to learn how the best programmers in the world work right now? Copy their work and you can peer into their minds and understand exactly how they think.</p>

              <p>There are lot of blog posts on how laziness is a quality of a good programmer but you’ve gotta be a developer to find those blogs sometimes. I want to talk about evaluating the laziness of a programming consultant and how it can be a good or bad thing.</p>

<p>If you know anything about building software, you learn very quickly that it’s a whole lot of trial and error. You make a change, refresh the browser, and see if it worked.</p>

<p>Rinse, repeat. <strong>Sometimes for every. freaking. change.</strong> (Those of you who’ve built software for Internet Explorer have been there.)</p>

<p>Being a software developer consists of a whole lot repetitive tasks and that’s where laziness comes in. A developer who gets frustrated quickly with repetitive tasks will be the first to build a tool to automate it. They’ll figure out how to refresh their browser automatically with every code change. They’ll make a tool to clear the database and test the file import again for them automatically. If it has a pattern, they’ll realize it and automate it.</p>

<p>A lot of times, I’ll see clients who <strong><em>need</em></strong> software built but they’ve been running this manual repetitive process for so long they have kind of forgotten that it was a problem. It’s inefficient and it’s wasting time and money.</p>

<h2>Enter the lazy programmer</h2>

<p>If you hired a software developer you could explain the process and, if you’re really lucky, he could whip up a quick solution in a couple hours. Sometimes it is more complicated, but forcing your workflow into Excel isn’t usually the best solution in the long term.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is the framework of choice for a lot of software developers who want to prototype solutions to business workflows like these. It’s got all the tools you need to build a quick and dirty automated process within a few hours. You can get straight to business and seeing the fog clear. Your optimized business workflow is going to make you and your customers happier people and it’s probably going to make you a whole lot of money in the process.</p>

<p><strong>I sometimes say that the lazier a developer is, the better.</strong> That’s not to say that taking shortcuts in code is the right solution. A lazy developer will know that shortcuts often don’t play out well in the long term. Planning up front will save him time in the long term. A lazy programmer plays long ball. He works towards the long term. He also knows when to take shortcuts. If an idea is not fleshed out well or is based upon assumptions, then a lazy programmer will be the one to argue that we try something new, test it, measure the feedback, and make a decision based upon the results. It’s more work and money if we build software upon assumptions that needs to be redone later. Nobody wants that.</p>

<p>When changes need to be made in the future, the lazy developer can make them with ease because he planned properly. The developer who over engineered the problem is usually the one who worked himself into a box. He built a box with a thousand features in the beginning. It was maginificent. Or so he thought. It turns out that the box he designed isn’t able to be reshaped along with the business.</p>

<p>So if you hear me say that laziness is a virtue, well now you know. Lazy is no longer a bad four letter word. It’s a blessing.</p>

              <p>I’ve had some fun recently playing Ryan Bate’s <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior">Ruby Warrior</a>. It’s a little text based adventure game where you build the AI for the player. Each level gets increasingly more difficult so you start writing more and more complex code. As you go along, you can get caught in the complexity of the code, so I made this video to help give examples of how I was handling the first few levels of complexity.</p>

<p>So without further adieu, here’s the video. This was recorded off the cuff without any editing so it won’t be the greatest, but hopefully you’ll pickup a trick or two. The screen resolution is fairly high, so you may want to watch this either in fullscreen or on Youtube in HD.</p>
