              <p>A few days ago I was asked what I wanted for Christmas. As always, I said I couldn’t think of anything.</p>

<p>I mean, after all, I have an apartment, a car, a job, plenty of food, several computers, and a TV. What more could I really need? I’ve got more than enough to live on, and really there is nothing for me to complain about. I don’t want anything because there is nothing I need.</p>

<p>For other people, I’m afraid that’s not the case. Among the few basic needs humans have, water is one of them. And there are lots of people in this world who don’t have access to fresh water.</p>

<p>Instead of getting things I don’t really need, like some new video game, I’d rather see the money spent on something that matters.</p>

<p>The Occupy Wall Street protestors believe they deserve everything. That they are entitled. But you know what? None of them have had to walk 3 hours a day to get fresh water. And neither have I. But instead of complaining about rich people being richer than me, I try to be thankful for what I have. I try to be thankful I have fresh water. I try to be thankful for having everything I need to live and more. It’s easy to forget how easy our lives really are.</p>

<p>So if you’re thankful and you’re in the giving mood this season, consider donating to my Charity Water campaign or start your own. A new TV may improve your life a little, and you may deserve it, but a well for fresh water will completely change a child’s life.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/22566556">Water Changes Everything.</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/charitywater">charity: water</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to giving. After seeing all the people in the Occupy WallStreet movement who believe they’re entitled to things without working hard, I think it’s time for a change. All it takes is $20 to give someone clean water. $20 to change someone’s life. They deserve it, and they will appreciate it more than you can imagine.</p>

<p>Make Christmas about giving again. Please donate.</p>

              <p>Russell Davies’ <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2006/11/how_to_be_inter.html">excellent post</a> the other day challenged people to be more interesting. This something I think a lot of people need to read.</p>

<p>We are the Myspace, the Facebook, and the Twitter generation. We are so called “social” people. What do we do? We post things about ourselves on these networks to share with others. These services are filled with people primarily posting about themselves. They’re not sharing. They’re bragging and trying to feel important.</p>

<p>Those people with thousands of followers? They don’t post about themselves as often. They share interesting articles, images, and videos. And not only that, they start conversations about them.</p>

<p>We all like to talk about ourselves to some extent. It’s human nature. We can’t help it.</p>

<p>But being interesting isn’t that hard. Just be able to converse about lots of topics without talking about yourself.</p>

<p>What we could do better though is to create value. Create conversations, write about things you normally wouldn’t, share content. Write responses about movies you’ve seen, images you’ve found, articles you’ve read.</p>

<p>Being able to converse on any topic will allow you to network better, build better friendships, connect with more customers, and generally improve your life.</p>

<p>Get other people’s opinions on things, learn something from them. Be curious. Be interesting.</p>

              <p>“Simplicty.” It’s a word we hear often, but it’s meaning is fleeting to most.</p>

<p><a href="http://raganwald.posterous.com/simplicity-is-not-a-simple-concept">This post</a> explores “simplicty” in phones. We have rotary phones that are simple by limiting the uses it has (Limited Simplicity). We have business style phones with lots of buttons and shortcuts that add simplicity for power users (Power User Simplicity). And we have what he calls “elegant design” where the iPhone’s use cases are maximized by using sets of smaller tools to fulfill more use cases (Elegant Simplicty).</p>

<p>The thing about this description of “simplicity” is that it doesn’t mean the same to different people. Personally, I see the iPhone as Limited simplicity. My parents see it with Elegant simplicity or Power User simplicity. And my grandparents don’t think it’s simple at all. In fact, my grandparents are scared to touch it at all. Business owners and employees will find the business style phone with it’s 100 buttons elegantly simple because of how they use it, nobody else will feel the same.</p>

<p>Rarely will simplicity take upon the same meaning to everyone, so simplicity is even more complex than that.</p>

<p>The most important experience you can do is find the target market that you want to achieve elegant simplicity with. These are the customers to focus on and you want to “wow” them. Don’t think you need to be a catch all, be specific.</p>
