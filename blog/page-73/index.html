              <p>It has begun increasingly apparent to me recently that far too many business are trying to do too much with their products. Why does my microwave need <em>that</em> many features? Why does my media player have so many unnecessary options and still suck at playing music? The list could go on forever.</p>

<p>If you sit and think about it, the things you don’t like using often try to do too much. They fail to accomplish any real innovation because they cannot focus on the specific tasks they are intended to improve. I think the problem lies with companies having misplaced incentives. “What is the main goal of your company?” you ask. “To innovate and improve the way we do things with technology” they reply. What most of them really mean is that they want to make money. Well, you’re putting too much thought into how you can make a profit instead of doing what will, in the long run, produce the best end result as a product and long lasting business now aren’t you? Focus on doing a single task, and do it right. If that works out, then you’re golden. Go ahead and continue to improve upon what you’ve created, but do it in the same mindset, build upon it from different angles, but don’t forget what your intentions are.</p>

<p>You could make this argument about any competing products, for example Myspace vs Facebook. Myspace tried to do too much and Facebook took a simpler approach to connect people. Even look at Facebook early on versus itself now. It’s become much simpler, disallowing applications by third parties that were, for the most part, purely driven by seeking ad revenue. You can apply this to much more than business. The best website themes are often the most functional. Gmail is simplistic and very usable; Facebook is clean but elegant. This is also a major reason why open source products are so much better than proprietary ones. Without continuously worrying about how they’re going to make money, they’re able to focus, listen to their users, and innovate. Proprietary software has to bend their plans in order to continue keeping up with this innovation by copying off of them. It’s not often that a product from Microsoft shows true innovation in an area unless there are few competing open source projects. Microsoft Office might be one of the applications that has showed innovation because they have become such a market leader for office software. Even projects like OpenOffice currently cannot compete with Office on a business level because of the lack of features, but it’s only a matter of time before OOo is able to out do Office in many ways where it will be able to successfully start replacing Office in businesses. It’s already begun to have an incredibly strong home user backing.</p>

<p>In the end, I want everyone to go out and apply this to life and work. Instead of doing things “the way it’s always been done”, challenge yourself and try to use that simplicity to innovate and improve upon whats already out there. No reason to reinvent the wheel right?</p>

              <p>Hard to believe Google Summer of Code 2009 is over already and that school will be starting up next week. I want to say thanks to Bertrand Cachet and Pierre-Jean Coudert for their support as mentors on WinLibre.</p>

<p>Our project has come a long ways. With some initial design hurdles past us, we were able to get hard at work creating a package system for Windows that would be both reliable and flexible. There are a lot more design issues with a package system on Windows than we had anticipated, especially with the vast amount of ways that applications are released to the public. We designed WinLibre to be extremely simple to package and release for developers without having to change the way they currently ship their releases.</p>

<p>I was tasked with the package creator. All in all it was a good end result, got a lot done and learned an indescribable amount of things. I was able to implement as much as possible without a few features from the other students in the project. We’ve all had our plates full and had some rough times but it’s about the love for open source and community when it comes down to it. Here are a list of things working in the package creator:</p>

<ul>
<li>CLI support</li>
<li>wxPython GUI</li>
<li>Initialize package</li>
<li>Set package meta data</li>
<li>Set install scripts</li>
<li>Add files to package</li>
</ul>


<p>A few things have yet to be completed such as package relationships (depends, recommends, etc), install script templates and examples, sample packages, and package submission to the repository. These features will be implemented in the future and I plan to continue contributing to this project.</p>

<p>Google Summer of Code has brought a lot of good experiences to many students, teaching them about community, open source, and even things about themselves. I want to thank Google for sponsoring such a wonderful program and to all those who participated!</p>

              <p class="date">Aug 11, 2009</p>

              <p>Recently I was helping mac9416 work on CLI parsing for the upcoming Keryx 1.0. He was running into some trouble with the logging module. What happened was that everything he was setting up for the logger was basically being overwritten with the defaults. The original code looked something like this, with libkeryx importing logging as well.</p>

<blockquote><p><code>import logging, platform, sys
from optparse import OptionParser</code></p>

<p>LOG_FORMAT = '%(asctime)s %(levelname) %(message)s'
DATE = '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S'</p>

<p>def parse(args=None):
""" Parses options and arguments passed """
parser = OptionParser(usage=USAGE, version='%s %s' % (PROGRAM, VERSION))
parser.set_defaults(log_level=logging.WARNING)
parser.add_option('-V', '--verbose', action='store_const', dest="log_level", const=logging.INFO, help='Show vervose output')
parser.add_option('-d', '--debug', action='store_const', dest="log_level", const=logging.DEBUG, help='Show debugging output')
return parser.parse_args()</p>

<p>def main(argv=None):
""" Main function of execution """
import libkeryx
opts, args = parse()
print opts.log_level
logging.basicConfig(name=lib.appName, level=opts.log_level, format=LOG_FORMAT, date=DATE)</p></blockquote>

<p>And this was giving the output as such:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>ERROR:root:message</code></p></blockquote>

<p>This did not print any of our info or debug messages because it defaults to the ERROR logging level.What we were looking for was using the root logger across all modules so that we could have a single logging mechanism that would be easily set at the same level of any frontend. This wasn’t using our customized message format, nor was it using the proper logging level. It was set properly, but nothing was working correct.</p>

<p>After a bit of trial and error, I found the solution. In libkeryx, we were importing logging. The logging module was being first imported in the main python file, then it was being setup in libkeryx, and THEN it was being initialized with our basicConfig in the main file. This causes problems because logging is imported in multiple locations and is not configured beforehand. The solution? First thing, import logging, parse the CLI arguments and configure logging before you do anything else:</p>

<blockquote><p><code># Setup logging
import logging</code></p>

<p>def parse(args=None):
""" Parses options and arguments passed """
parser = OptionParser(usage=USAGE, version='%s %s' % (PROGRAM, VERSION))
parser.set_defaults(log_level=logging.WARNING)
parser.add_option('-V', '--verbose', action='store_const', dest="log_level", const=logging.INFO, help='Show vervose output')
parser.add_option('-d', '--debug', action='store_const', dest="log_level", const=logging.DEBUG, help='Show debugging output')
return parser.parse_args()</p>

<p>opts, args = parse()</p>

<p>LOG_FORMAT = '%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s'
DATE = '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S'
logging.basicConfig(level=opts.log_level, format=LOG_FORMAT, date=DATE)</p>

<h1>Rest of imports go here</h1>

<p>import libkeryx</p></blockquote>

<p>What this does is allows us to configure the root logger before everyone else gets a hold of it. This gives it default properties of level, format, and date automatically to the other modules that use it, in our case, libkeryx. Order is key here, and because libkeryx is just a module, we want it to automatically inherit the logging level of the script importing it.</p>
