              <p><img src="http://excid3.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/bruce-lee.jpeg" title="bruce-lee" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. We’d run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-tow minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a-half minutes per mile].
So this morning he said to me “We’re going to go five.”</p>

<p>I said, “Bruce, I can’t go five. I’m a helluva lot older than you are, and I can’t do five.”</p>

<p>He said, “When we get to three, we’ll shift gears and it’s only two more and you’ll do it.”</p>

<p>I said “Okay, hell, I’ll go for it.”</p>

<p>So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and I’m okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out.</p>

<p>I’m tired, my heart’s pounding, I can’t go any more and so I say to him, “Bruce if I run any more,” — and we’re still running — “if I run any more I’m liable to have a heart attack and die.” He said, “Then die.” It made me so mad that I went the full five miles.</p>

<p>Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, “Why did you say that?” He said, “Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it’ll spread over into the rest of your life. It’ll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.”</p></blockquote>

              <p>Today was my last day at The Able Few. This marks the beginning of my new company, <a href="http://lithoslabs.com" title="Lithos Labs">Lithos Labs</a>. We had an amazing 10 months together at The Able Few and built a lot of really cool things. Although for me personally, something was missing.</p>

<p>For one, many of us spend our lives as followers. I have been guilty of this for 23 years. Most of the major decisions in life were directed by other people. Where I went to school, where I got my first few jobs, the list goes on. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed how things went, but I had never felt like I was making the decision myself. If I did anything, there were several reasons pushing me to do so.</p>

<p>Starting my own company, however, is completely different. I choose who I work with, what I work on, when I work on it, and how I work on it. From this point forward, I control my destiny. Nobody is leading me down this path other than myself. It’s a new and refreshing feeling. I’ve wanted to strike out on my own for years now and if I kept pushing this off I may never start.</p>

<p><strong>The best time to start was yesterday, second best time is today.</strong></p>

<p>The second major reason for starting my own company is because of my past experience and goals. As an open source developer I have known what it’s like to build a product, ship it, maintain it, and grow a community around. Keryx had some die hard fans and I shipped over 100,000 copies. I knew I was building something people wanted, needed, and loved. Knowing I’m always working on something that matters is incredibly important to me.</p>

<p>That’s why, as I move forward I want to focus on building products that matter. Focusing on topics such as education, company culture, and anything to simplify people’s lives, we hope to achieve success by helping others do the same.</p>

<p>We will be doing consulting and contract work, so if you’d like to hire us please <a href="mailto:contact@lithoslabs.com" title="Contact Lithos Labs">contact us</a>.</p>
