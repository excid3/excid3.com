              <p>I think this happens to all of us. The bar is set high, so you give up your time. You don’t have to be a developer to experience this. Combating burnout can take time, but it’s also a skill you need to learn. You can learn when you’re starting to take a dive into the depths of burnout and hopefully catch yourself before it happens.</p>

<h2>Independent? Find Someone to Work With</h2>

<p>I’m an independent developer. That means I’m working from home alone the majority of my day. This makes me highly productive with a significant drop in distractions, but you’re also sacrificing the interactions you would have with coworkers. Things like going out to lunch every day, helping each other solve problems, and brainstorming together.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on <a href="http://FeedForward.io" title="FeedForward.io">FeedForward.io</a> lately to combat this feeling. We’re curating thought provoking information together so that we can discuss it and learn from each other. Sites like Hacker News can provide an incredible amount of important criticism, but often it’s presented in a manner that makes it feel like a battleground rather than constructive criticism. Starting a podcast to discuss our favorite article(s) each week is another thing that has helped immensely. It’s essentially a digital mastermind group:</p>

<blockquote><p>A small club of like-minded advanced talents who meet periodically for mutual brainstorming/accountability sessions.</p></blockquote>

<p>We were informally doing this bi-weekly meeting for dinner to discuss random topics and philosophies. After trading a bunch of emails and needing to do something new, I sat down one night and built the first version of <a href="http://FeedForward.io" title="FeedForward.io">FeedForward.io</a>. So far it’s turned out better than I could have planned. If you’d like to get involved, please check it out and then <a href="mailto:chris@excid3.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20join%20FeedForward.io!" title="I want to join FeedForward.io!">email me</a>.</p>

<h2>Work On Something New Just For Fun</h2>

<p>Building FeedForward.io has been immensely fun, but I’ve also been cleaning up and working on <a href="https://rubygems.org/profiles/53192" title="Chris Oliver's RubyGems profile">some gems</a> that I maintain <a href="http://github.com/excid3">on Github</a>. I don’t need any new functionality on these, but I’m sure that improving them will help other people.</p>

<p>I actually started most of these projects believing that I probably wouldn’t learn anything from them and I was wrong each time. There are always challenges you will come across and those are the interesting things. Those will rejuvenate you.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar" title="simple_calendar on Github">SimpleCalendar</a> started out as a me being annoyed with the other calendar gems out there. I just wanted something simple, so I built it. It’s been interesting to work on, not because it’s a calendar, but because I’m learning how to better document and write more flexible libraries for other people to use. I recently released a new version that works with not only ActiveRecord, but Mongoid, any other ORM, or just plain Ruby classes because of a feature request.</p>

<p>It was fun because I am helping people directly. Knowing I’m helping people is something that can quickly revive my waining motivation. It can be something as simple as a 15 minute thing and I’ll feel instantly refreshed.</p>

<h2>Simply Getting Away For A Bit</h2>

<p>This tactic I’m a bit on the fence about. If you can truly escape for a few days, then it can be immensely helpful to do just that. On the other hand, chances are if you’re feeling burnt out or stressed because of lots of work, it’s just putting off the problem. In the end, leaving for a couple days might just be making you worry and get further behind.</p>

<p>Shorter breaks, however, I always find helpful. Take a walk for at least half an hour. Take a drive or go out to dinner somewhere. You can go with friends, but going alone I find even more helpful. I have no choice but to think and be retrospective about what’s causing stress. Use that time to figure out what’s the problem and potential solutions. If your work is flexible, try working from a different coffee shop than you’re used to. Work from the library. You need a change of location sometimes to revert your mindset.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Burn out sucks, but it’s bound to happen. Make sure you’ve got some tricks up your sleeve for combating burnout. You can’t accomplish anything if you can’t work.</p>

              <p>The default Rails error page is useful, however it can be a bear to tread through most times. There is so much output that we don’t usually need and on the other hand, there is a lot of other things we might need to see.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors" title="better_errors">better_errors</a> comes in.</p>

<p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/09c0e85b85d525d7a79757f1552248dae5c43dac/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f75725644572e706e67" alt="better_errors gem" /></p>

<p>The features of this are awesome:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full stack trace</li>
<li>Source code inspection for all stack frames (with highlighting)</li>
<li>Local and instance variable inspection</li>
<li>Live REPL on every stack frame</li>
</ul>


<p>Local and instance variable inspection is so useful, not to mention a live <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="REPL">REPL</a>!</p>

<p>This means that you can immediately see the instance variables that are set at the time of the error. You can even drill into the stack frames inside Rails to see what instance variables it was using to evaluate the action. The embedded source code is incredibly useful as well so that you can see what’s wrong immediately without having to dig through your application to find the offending line.</p>

<p>Quite the nifty gem! There are a handful of things that need work, such as the errors should also probably still be logged to the console. Since this only runs in development though, you will have the standard Rails errors you’re used to debugging with in the logs.</p>

              <p>An American businessman was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied, that it only took a little while. The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish. The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs.</p>

<p>The American then asked, “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”</p>

<p>The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.”</p>

<p>The American scoffed. “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise.”</p>

<p>The Mexican fisherman asked, “But señor, how long will this all take?”</p>

<p>To which the American replied, “Fifteen or twenty years.”</p>

<p>“But what then, señor?”</p>

<p>The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.”</p>

<p>“Millions, señor? Then what?”</p>

<p>The American said, “Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”</p>
