              <p>This past week was Thanksgiving and the infamous Black Friday. Every year I’m reminded of the importance of creating things. I’d rather be the one behind the counter selling products than the one racing through the store to grab a new TV. I think most people would, but it comes down to their mindset.</p>

<p>A lot of people look at the world as a set of rules and regulations. We must follow those rules, try not to smash into the walls, collect our bi-weekly paychecks and hope that we can afford a house of our own eventually. This is the mindset of the average consumer and that’s absolutely fine.</p>

<p>As a developer though, I can often catch myself looking at the world from a different angle. Black Friday screams “Look at how all these people line up to buy things they don’t need just because you made it feel special.” People wait days. Hundreds of people in line. Strategic plans to grab the 3 items they want to get before they’re gone.</p>

<p>Seeing this from another perspective makes you realize that <strong>you</strong> could be the one selling things. You could be the person where people are waiting in line to buy from you. The more you create, the more your focus shifts from consuming things to helping people. And that’s a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>When you realize this, you can start looking at the world differently. You notice opportunities. Ways to help. Ways to make a difference. Ways to get ahead. Ways to actually live your life. You realize that almost everything in the world was created by other people just like you. Those people orchestrated something magnificent.</p>

<p>And yet, what they did seemed impossible for you to do. Actually, it <em>was</em> impossible to you before, but now you have creator’s goggles on. It’s like peering at the world through an x-ray machine. You can see how things are accomplished. How things are created. How sales are made. You see everything as an opportunity. You see the future.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re not to this point yet. Maybe you’re starting to realize it, but it hasn’t truly sunk in yet. “How do I get there?” you ask. The way you get there is by creating. By doing.</p>

<p><strong>Buy less, create more.</strong></p>

              <p>If you’ve spent any time using software, you’ll notice that some applications just feel great. Maybe it’s Github, Basecamp, or something else. Using it just feels solid. But why are they great and how can I build great software?</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s hard to put your finger on just what exactly creates this feeling. As a user, you have this subliminal feeling that the software is great. That feeling comes from many things: speed, design, usability, and many other things.</p>

<p>As developers, everything is under a microscope. It’s easy to see where things might get complicated and that’s where the separate of great software and bad software begins.</p>

<p>Just take the simple example of dates and times. How are you handling timezones? Are you allowing the user to type in the date and time or are you forcing some jQuery widget down their throats? Which is easier to use often?</p>

<p>Things differentiate quickly now. You chose a jQuery date AND time widget because it’s easier. But you forgot to think about the users. They almost always are choosing a 15 or 30 minute increment of time. Oh well, what if we use a date picker and a drop down for times and let them edit the times if they need something more specific? Maybe you should. Maybe you shouldn’t.</p>

<p>All developers have problems with this at some point. <strong>Whether you’re a consultant or employee, you need to use the software that you are building.</strong> If you don’t, how can you know which is the best choice?</p>

<p>Remember that solutions problems in software is always going to be unique. If you don’t know the answer, ask your users. They won’t always know the answer either, so you can’t always ask directly. Show them one way, have them use it for real, and viciously take notes.</p>

<p>Did they get tripped up on how to set the time to 2:09pm? Then you might not want to have 15 minute time increments if they’re already trying to do things differently.</p>

<p>Good developers notice that these situations are problems. They may not stop people from using your product, but it certainly might stop them from using it twice.</p>

<p>Your job as the creator is to solve problems in ways that are elegant. Find out what things are a hinderance to the users and fix them. Minimum viable product can mean many different things. To me, it’s not viable if it’s hard to use.</p>

<p>Pay attention to what you’re building and you can create great software too.</p>

              <p>With the introduction of CoffeeScript coming with Rails since version 3.1, a lot of people have begun making heavy use of it. Most of my CoffeeScript use has been with assets, while I haven’t been using CoffeeScript for Rails views.</p>

<h2>First, Rails Views Using Javascript</h2>

<p>By default, Rails forms with the <code>remote: true</code> option set, will submit as JS to the server. An example request from your logs would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Processing by ProjectController#create as JS
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>as JS</code> portion will instruct the Rails controller to use the Javascript format for rendering a view as the result. You can toss in a file named <code>app/views/main/create.js.erb</code> and write any Javascript and ERB that you’d like. Let’s just say we have this Javascript we want to execute on a successful AJAX create:</p>

<pre><code>$("ul#projects-list").append("&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @project.name %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;");
</code></pre>

<p>This just pretends that we have a list of projects, and we want to add the new project to the page without refreshing after we’ve created it. Pretty simple.</p>

<p>This is fine and dandy, but what if we want to switch</p>

<h2>Switching to using CoffeeScript for Rails views</h2>

<p>Let’s switch this create view over to CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>First, we want to switch the filename from <code>create.js.erb</code> to <code>create.js.coffee.erb</code>. This instructs Rails to use CoffeeScript when rendering the view.</p>

<p>You can then swap the code inside over to CoffeeScript:</p>

<pre><code>$("ul#projects-list").append "&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= @project.name %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>This isn’t a great example to show off CoffeeScript’s capabilities, but chances are you won’t have anything too complex in these types of views anyways.</p>

<h3>Not finding CoffeeScript views in Rails production environment</h3>

<p>While this is actually completely functional in development, the way that Rails includes the CoffeeScript gem is that it will only be used for asset compilation on a deployment. In development, you need to always compile your CoffeeScript no matter what, however in production, the assumption is that you’re only using CoffeeScript in the assets directory. The reason for this is that in production, you want to do the least amount of work necessary, and rendering CoffeeScript for these small views should be considered unnecessary.</p>

<p>If you’re working on a smaller app however, it’s not such a big deal and you may prefer to write everything in CoffeeScript so that you can learn it better.</p>

<p>So using CoffeeScript for Rails views in production simply requires us to modify the Gemfile slightly. Take out the <code>coffee-rails</code> and <code>uglifier</code> gems from the <code>assets</code> group and move them outside. For a Rails 3.2 application, you’d end up with a Gemfile that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails',   '~&gt; 3.2.3'
  gem "bourbon", "~&gt; 1.4.0"
  gem 'jquery-fileupload-rails', "~&gt; 0.3.4"

  # See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs#readme for more supported runtimes
  # gem 'therubyracer', :platforms =&gt; :ruby
end

gem 'coffee-rails', '~&gt; 3.2.1'
gem 'uglifier', '&gt;= 1.0.3'
</code></pre>

<p>Save this, commit it, and the next time your run a deploy to your server, you’ll be able to handle the AJAX requests with CoffeeScript in production now.</p>
