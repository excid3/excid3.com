              <p>If you’ve been using Rails 3.0 and 3.1 recently, you’ll notice that the changes in Rake 0.9.2 are incompatible. Without a doubt, you’ll run into this error at least once a day:</p>

<pre><code>You have already activated rake 0.9.2, but your Gemfile requires rake 0.8.7. Consider using bundle exec.
</code></pre>

<p>Incredibly annoying right? Instead of removing rake 0.9.2 like most people suggest, try this solution instead:</p>

<pre><code>alias rake='bundle exec rake'
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll need bundler and a Gemfile in your project (there are cases where you might be using a project that doesn’t, like <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">janus</a>). If you don’t have one you’ll get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Could not locate Gemfile
</code></pre>

<p>That’s not a big deal though. If you want to run simply “rake” and not “bundle exec rake” like we just aliased it to you can do run this:</p>

<pre><code>`which rake`
</code></pre>

<p>The back ticks will execute the command in a subshell and execute it’s results. If you’re like me, the amount of times you want to run rake without a Gemfile is fairly uncommon so this makes things a lot simpler on a regular basis.</p>

              <p>As someone who never really enjoyed writing in school, I avoided it to no end. I’d put it off and always crank out a paper at the last minute. I’m sure they had good intentions, but I never understood why we had to write those stupid papers. Why do either of us care about my thoughts as to why the egyptians built pyramids or how I changed when I entered middle school? Looking back on it now after highschool is over, I understand it a lot better.</p>

<p><strong>Writing is important.</strong></p>

<p>The ability to organize your thoughts is powerful. I, like many others, can tend to be scatterbrained. Writing down my thoughts forces me to organize them and convey them in a manner that is understandable by others.</p>

<p><strong>Writing makes you understand.</strong></p>

<p>How is that? Just sit down and write. Eventually you will realize it. Having writer’s block means that it isn’t clear in your mind yet.</p>

<p>Take a break and think; go for a walk, come back and write. You’re forced to understand yourself when you write, otherwise it just becomes a big mess. It is increasingly harder to do in our world of continuous information overload.</p>

<p>If you find it hard to follow  when writing emails, take a minute to make sure you know what you want to say. Try doing this and whittle yourself down to 3 or 4 sentences after a while. You’ll feel a sense of clarity. The readers will to.</p>

<p><strong>Writing helps others to understand.</strong></p>

<p>A while ago Jason Fried write a blog post on Signal vs Noise called <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2647-the-class-id-like-to-teach">The class I’d like to teach</a>. Here’s a little excerpt:</p>

<blockquote><p>It would be a writing course. Every assignment would be delivered in five versions: A three page version, a one page version, a three paragraph version, a one paragraph version, and a one sentence version.</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea is struck me as absolutely brilliant. Focus on the important thoughts. Asking for an explanation from someone usually results in a 25 minute discussion that goes off topic 3 times and ends up talking in circles. Being able to condense your ideas is an exceptional skill that most people don’t have.</p>

<p><strong>When you’re asked a question about a topic, you can be the expert.</strong></p>

<p>You can share you writing. What you’ve written is now also organized in your mind. When someone asks you a question you can give them a short, straightforward answer. That, combined with being able to see the writing on your website quickly allows you to become an expert in their eyes. Being the expert brings a lot questions your way which can help to continue improving your knowledge of the topic as well.</p>

<p>Give it a shot. Don’t force yourself, but try to keep a pace. It’s worth it. I promise.</p>

              <p>Following a discussion on Twitter with my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/AstonJ">@astonj</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BuddyLindsey">@buddylindsey</a>, we were commenting on the difference between Ruby and Python. There’s certainly no language that is better than another, however I wanted to point out a few things between the two languages that I did and didn’t necessarily like.</p>

<p>I come from a background of 4 years of Python experience and have been working with Ruby for only one year. Over this last year, my experience with the two languages has been very interesting. A little bit of background: My python experience was
primarily working on <a href="http://keryxproject.org">Keryx</a> and a few Django web apps. Most of my Ruby experience has been building websites.</p>

<p>The main difference between the two languages’ feel is the ability to be explicit. This is something Python holds dear to its design. Take a twitter library for example. In Python you have a file called “twitter.py” and ruby you have a folder called “twitter.rb” each with a <code>class Twitter</code> inside. Simple enough, but what about using these in code:</p>

<pre><code>from twitter import Twitter

t = Twitter()



require 'twitter'

t = Twitter.new
</code></pre>

<p>Both languages are very similar in structure, however Python is simply more explicit. When you use a library, you import exactly what you need. For me, this was an incredibly confusing point coming into Ruby. Why are you letting all these classes becoming available when I don’t even know what all might be there? I don’t even know what documentation to look at most the time unless I have a full stack trace in Ruby.</p>

<p>While being explicit is nice, it also adds a lot of unnecessary things. Take this for example:</p>

<pre><code>class DVDPlayer
    def __init__(self, disc):
        self.disc



class DVDPlayer
  def initialize(disc)
    @disc = disc
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I feel the Ruby version is a lot more succinct and readable for anyone to understand. Having <code>self</code> in every method seems unnecessary especially since it is required. Why do you need to declare it? Sure you can see where it comes from, but still you need to understand the concept of <code>self</code>. If you don’t understand it then it won’t make sense in either case.</p>

<p>Another thing to mention about this code example is <code>__init__</code> vs <code>initialize</code>. If you look at <code>__init__</code> it seems a little wonky. This is because Python doesn’t have the concept of private or protected attributes or methods. Normally in Python a private or protected attribute or method is prepended with an underscore or double underscore depending upon how private you want it to appear. This seems to jive well with the concepts of Ruby encouraging monkey patching, while Python is more conservative on this front.</p>

<p>Blocks are probably my favorite part in Ruby. On the surface, it’s similar to list comprehensions and passing a function to another function in Python, but it’s considerably cleaner. Ruby showcases this in loops well:</p>

<pre><code>nums = 0..9
nums.each { |n| puts n }

# OR
# nums.each do |n|
#   puts n
# end



nums = range(10)
for n in nums:
    print n
</code></pre>

<p>Chaining in Ruby happens a lot and seems more expressive per line than Python. Often trying to write the same code in Python that I could do succinctly on 3 lines would be 6 in Python to keep the same level of clarity it feels like.</p>

<p>I could go on endlessly, but I don’t think it would do much good. If you like either language, enjoy it. No need to start a flame war, languages are mostly personal preference. Of course, I’m no expert in either language so take this with a grain of salt. I’ve fallen in love with Ruby’s flexibility and syntax over the past year and find it hard writing Python anymore. Feel free to comment your thoughts!</p>
