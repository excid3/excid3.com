        <p>It's something I hear time and time again. Developers tend to think from their point of view. They understand how to write and use complicated software but that's because they do it for a living.</p>
        <blockquote>Most developers won't sit down with you long enough to really understand your problems.</blockquote>
        <p>They're too focused on shoveling this complicated software in your direction that they have already built. It doesn't <em>really</em> fit your needs, but they assure you they can bend it into something you can use.</p>
        <p><strong>But that's barely better than the complicated spreadsheet in Excel</strong> that you use right now, only it's probably less flexible.</p>
        <p>The trouble is you've got this problem that needs to be solved with software, but you need to find a developer who can build a solution that is going to be simple for you to use and isn't going to break the bank.</p>

      <div class="span8 offset2">
        <h1 class="centered">Shouldn't you be able to find a developer that understands your problems?</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="span6 offset3">
        <p>Imagine being able to sit down and talk with a developer who understands you and your business. They understand budgets, goals, and work with you to really iron out your online business.</p>
        <p>What if the developer you hired could:</p>

        <div class="bullet">
          <i class="icon-chevron-sign-right green"></i>
          Increase your customer life time value
        </div>
        <div class="bullet">
          <i class="icon-chevron-sign-right green"></i>
          Build more loyalty with your customers
        </div>
        <div class="bullet">
          <i class="icon-chevron-sign-right green"></i>
          Improve your bottom line
        </div>
        <div class="bullet last">
          <i class="icon-chevron-sign-right green"></i>
          Create a large return on investment in the web
        </div>

        <p>What if you could sit back and relax knowing that you had a developer who was going to do the right thing?</p>

        <p>Our services cover a wide range of web development, from building your first prototype to rehabbing a rickety old website.</p>
        <blockquote>The process we take is to build software in iterations. We build one chunk at a time to make sure that it works as planned.</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook don't make major changes overnight.</strong> They improve their software step by step, measuring each improvement to make sure people like what they're building.</p>
        <p>You'll notice that these successful online companies don't operate on assumptions, they operate on data.</p>
        <p><strong>We build, measure, improve and grow your online business.</strong> Great software comes from experimenting with ideas and finding the right answers.</p>
        <p>That's our process and it produces amazing results.</p>
