        <p>Everyone has an idea for a product but it's not often that you see people actually make it a reality.</p>
        <p>You're up against so many odds:</p>

        <div class="bullet">
          <i class="icon-question-sign red"></i>
          Does anyone else care about this idea?
        </div>
        <div class="bullet">
          <i class="icon-question-sign red"></i>
          How do we find customers?
        </div>
        <div class="bullet">
          <i class="icon-question-sign red"></i>
          How much will it cost to build this?
        </div>
        <div class="bullet last">
          <i class="icon-question-sign red"></i>
          How soon can we prove that people will pay?
        </div>

        <p>These are all very tough questions to answer and sometimes it is hard to answer them without something to show them.</p>

      <div class="span8 offset2">
        <h1 class="centered">Let's take a look at one of our projects.</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="span6 offset3">
        <p>The idea for building a website so people could <a href="http://gorails.com">learn Ruby on Rails</a> was a simple one. Lots of people are building sites to teach software development with Ruby on Rails, but our idea was different.</p>
        <p>We wanted use our experience learning programming to provide a different approach for teaching. Without building everything up front, we wanted to prove our idea would work.</p>
        <p><img src="/img/gorails.png" alt="GoRails.com"></p>
        <p>The first thing we did was setup a landing page that explained our idea and gathered interest from potential users.</p>
        <p>By spending our time smartly, we were able to make a small investment and determine whether or not people liked what we were going to offer. As it turns out, some of what we had in mind worked extremely well, but other pieces didn't.</p>

      <div class="span8 offset2">
        <h1 class="centered">What about my idea?</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="span6 offset3">
        <p>Some ideas take a simple landing page and some content. You talk with customers and ask them if they're willing to pay for your service.</p>
        <p>Other projects require software to built first so that you have something to show your customers. They may need to see a prototype of your idea before they're convinced.</p>
        <p><strong>If you have need of just a simple landing page, we can help.</strong> We can set you up with a website, mailing list, and guide you through the process of testing your idea with potential customers.</p>
        <p>You may have already tested your idea and now you're looking for someone to develop the first prototype. It needs to be enough to get people using it, gathering feedback, data, and measuring how successful the idea is.</p>
        <p>That's where we come in.</p>
        <p><strong>We're software experts, so we can help you build a prototype that accomplishes your goals but doesn't break the bank.</strong> We will hit on all the important aspects of building a first software prototype that allows you to make smart decisions as your company goes forward.</p>
