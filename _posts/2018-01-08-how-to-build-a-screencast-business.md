It's been over 4 years now that I've posted my last blog post. That's
far, far too long!

So what have I been doing over the past 4 years? I've been working on
GoRails full-time.  I often like to reflect back on things and see just
how far they've come. I've learned an enormous amount in the past 4
years and want to share that with other people.

The whole reason I started GoRails was to take control of my time and
work on things I thought needed to exist in the world. This was
something I was already doing by working on startups, but it wasn't
fulfilling until I was working on my ideas. Those were the ones I cared
about most deeply and could get truly excited about.

Ruby on Rails is something I very much enjoy working with. Wanting to
give back to the community, I bought the domain and started posting
tutorials.
