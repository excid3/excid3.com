A while back I covered [Setting Up Ubuntu 12.04 with Ruby 1.9.3, Rails, Nginx, Passenger, and PostgreSQL or MySQL][1] and it’s gotten quite a lot of traffic. This video doesn’t cover the exact same setup process as the blog since the blog post is geared a little more towards a production server. Setting up a dev environment for the first time can take a lot of trial and error so I’ve kept this video to the minimum required steps to get your first Rails application setup.

I thought it would be nice to start a screencast series called GoRails (full site coming soon) to cover Rails a lot more in depth, but keeping the videos fairly short. So if you’re interested in GoRails, join my email newsletter on the sidebar at the top!
