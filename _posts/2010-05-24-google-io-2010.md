So I got the chance to fly out to San Francisco this year and attend the Google I/O conference. It was probably one of the coolest things I can say that I have ever been to. Over 5000 other developers being shown the next generation technology which Google and their many partners are developing and giving us a first hand glimpse before the world has a chance to hear about it. Quite an incredible experience, especially receiving a Sprint HTC Evo a month before the world gets it.

Iâ€™ve uploaded my stash of pictures, most of which were taken on the two phones that Google gave us freely for attending the conference. I was too busy enjoying the conference to take a whole lot indoors so most of the pictures are of the beautiful San Francisco landscape.
