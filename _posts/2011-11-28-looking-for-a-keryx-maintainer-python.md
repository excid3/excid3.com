It’s been a long road. I started [Keryx][1] over 4 years ago to learn Python, help dialup users, and give back to the Ubuntu community. While I learned a ton and met a lot of great people throughout the time, all good things come to an end sometime. I’d like to give a huge thank you to everyone who has helped me and motivated me to get Keryx this far. It wouldn’t be here without you!

A little background on Keryx: This project started my 8th grade year while I was learning Ubuntu on a dialup connection. It wasn’t easy to install packages, so I thought it be nice to have a portable application to download them from the Windows computers at school. I build Keryx then, a Python script capable of downloading the package lists, looking up dependencies, and figuring out exactly which packages you need to download. Since then, it’s grown a lot, seeing users in all over Africa, Asia, and rural places in the United States.

I haven’t been able to put the effort into Keryx as I would have liked. So instead of Keryx ending up in the “old and outdated” folder, I’d like to reach out and see if anyone would like to maintain it for me.

Keryx is currently sitting at over 80,000 downloads and doesn’t need much in the realm of bugfixes. There isn’t much to maintain, just looking for someone interested in Python.

If you know anyone who is interested, have them get a hold of me. I’m planning on finishing up the latest version and then calling it quits at the end of this year.
