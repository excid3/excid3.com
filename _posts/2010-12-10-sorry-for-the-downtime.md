Yesterday was schedule maintenance on the server. Bluemile Cloud was transferring it from the old Fivebean server to one of their new datacenters. I hoped everything would go smoothly, but it figures. I checked out analytics and noticed I dropped about 200 page views…and today I only had 15! (I don’t even know how the heck I got 15)

The site was using too much memory and was causing it to crash. I’m waiting on a response from Bluemile and hoping this gets resolved soon. I’ve since had to disable several things on the site, but it should be working normally for the most part. Hopefully this gets fully resolved soon so I can get a few of these blog posts written that I would like to.

It’s finals week so you might not hear anything much for another week, but at least the blog should be live hopefully.
