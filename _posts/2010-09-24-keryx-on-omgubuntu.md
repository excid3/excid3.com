It’s been a while since I’ve posted anything on here. Life has been hectic, senior year of college has begun, and I’m working quite a few hours each week. Little free time means I’m usually too exhausted during those hours to actually accomplish something productive. That’s going to change and I needed a little boost to get motivation. I submitted Keryx as a tip for OMG!Ubuntu! yesterday to help spread the word.

I certainly did not expect such an overwhelming and encouraging response from the community. ![:-\)][1] It really touched me, as this blossomed out of an itch I had, and I never expected to have contributed to so many users along the way. It’s been a rough 4 years learning Python, version control, proper programming styles, and managing a decent sized project for a college student with no experience. I never dreamed I’d have over 32,000 downloads.

I just wanted to stop for a moment and thank each and every one of you. Each download sparks another ounce of motivation, and the contributions of code, translations, and bug reports has been unbelievably helpful in teaching me and helping to build a better product. Again, thanks for being such a wonderful community, I’m just happy that I could be of help to at least one other Linux user. ![:D][2]
