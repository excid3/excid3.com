A few days ago I was asked what I wanted for Christmas. As always, I said I couldn’t think of anything.

I mean, after all, I have an apartment, a car, a job, plenty of food, several computers, and a TV. What more could I really need? I’ve got more than enough to live on, and really there is nothing for me to complain about. I don’t want anything because there is nothing I need.

For other people, I’m afraid that’s not the case. Among the few basic needs humans have, water is one of them. And there are lots of people in this world who don’t have access to fresh water.

Instead of getting things I don’t really need, like some new video game, I’d rather see the money spent on something that matters.

The Occupy Wall Street protestors believe they deserve everything. That they are entitled. But you know what? None of them have had to walk 3 hours a day to get fresh water. And neither have I. But instead of complaining about rich people being richer than me, I try to be thankful for what I have. I try to be thankful I have fresh water. I try to be thankful for having everything I need to live and more. It’s easy to forget how easy our lives really are.

So if you’re thankful and you’re in the giving mood this season, consider donating to my Charity Water campaign or start your own. A new TV may improve your life a little, and you may deserve it, but a well for fresh water will completely change a child’s life.

Let’s get back to giving. After seeing all the people in the Occupy WallStreet movement who believe they’re entitled to things without working hard, I think it’s time for a change. All it takes is $20 to give someone clean water. $20 to change someone’s life. They deserve it, and they will appreciate it more than you can imagine.

Make Christmas about giving again. Please donate.
