This interview with Paul Graham has a bunch of very awesome points he makes. Give it a watch and let me know what you think.

> “The reason hackers want to get rich is not so they can buy luxury items, it’s because they want freedom.” – Paul Graham

This really hit home for me as a developer.

> “Focus groups can only tell you what they want. Well designed software delivers more than what people know they want.” – Paul Graham

Software development is an art on some level, so you have to treat it as such. It’s going to take [a lot of practice][1] as well.
