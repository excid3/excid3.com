As someone who never really enjoyed writing in school, I avoided it to no end. I’d put it off and always crank out a paper at the last minute. I’m sure they had good intentions, but I never understood why we had to write those stupid papers. Why do either of us care about my thoughts as to why the egyptians built pyramids or how I changed when I entered middle school? Looking back on it now after highschool is over, I understand it a lot better.

**Writing is important.**

The ability to organize your thoughts is powerful. I, like many others, can tend to be scatterbrained. Writing down my thoughts forces me to organize them and convey them in a manner that is understandable by others.

**Writing makes you understand.**

How is that? Just sit down and write. Eventually you will realize it. Having writer’s block means that it isn’t clear in your mind yet.

Take a break and think; go for a walk, come back and write. You’re forced to understand yourself when you write, otherwise it just becomes a big mess. It is increasingly harder to do in our world of continuous information overload.

If you find it hard to follow  when writing emails, take a minute to make sure you know what you want to say. Try doing this and whittle yourself down to 3 or 4 sentences after a while. You’ll feel a sense of clarity. The readers will to.

**Writing helps others to understand.**

A while ago Jason Fried write a blog post on Signal vs Noise called [The class I’d like to teach][1]. Here’s a little excerpt:

> It would be a writing course. Every assignment would be delivered in five versions: A three page version, a one page version, a three paragraph version, a one paragraph version, and a one sentence version.

The idea is struck me as absolutely brilliant. Focus on the important thoughts. Asking for an explanation from someone usually results in a 25 minute discussion that goes off topic 3 times and ends up talking in circles. Being able to condense your ideas is an exceptional skill that most people don’t have.

**When you’re asked a question about a topic, you can be the expert.**

You can share you writing. What you’ve written is now also organized in your mind. When someone asks you a question you can give them a short, straightforward answer. That, combined with being able to see the writing on your website quickly allows you to become an expert in their eyes. Being the expert brings a lot questions your way which can help to continue improving your knowledge of the topic as well.

Give it a shot. Don’t force yourself, but try to keep a pace. It’s worth it. I promise.
