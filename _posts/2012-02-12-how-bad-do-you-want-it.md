There are a lot of times I hear people talk about wanting to do things. I talk about things like this all the time myself. The problem is most of the time we want success, but we don’t want to go through the hard work to get there.

As a high school student, I spent a lot of time naively working on Keryx. It was WAY above my knowledge level, and so I invested tons and tons of hours into building it. This ignorance allowed me to push my boundaries because I was completely unaware of the investment it would take to achieve my goal.

When you’re older, that problem flips sides. You realize how much time it will take, so you don’t even start. Instead of being able to charge head cluelessly, you have to face the problem of gauging whether or not you want to actually spend time on this idea.

This can be devastating to your ability to push yourself sometimes. If you deal with this feeling ever, watch this video:

Does this kind of content encourage you to get back in the saddle?
