I’ve watched this video many times and wanted to share it. The reason I like this so much is that it takes me into the mind of a designer. As a backend developer, I don’t typically think of the frontend design aspects as a designer would. This always means that my designs are clunky, but given a full walkthrough like this helps considerably.
