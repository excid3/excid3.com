I’ve been doing Rails fulltime for a while. Throughout all those hours, I’ve come across a lot of interesting situations and tips from around the web. Some have been best practices, some have been interesting solutions to problems.

With the plethora of content out there, I’ve decided to start keeping track of these snippets in a new series of blog posts that I will be calling Rails Tips. None of these tips will be breathtaking, but it might prove to be useful down the road. Each of the features will be individual blog posts, and I’ll be aggregating them onto the [Rails Tips][1] page here on my blog as well.

Let me know if you have any suggestions for topics to cover!
