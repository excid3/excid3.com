I really, really enjoyed this talk. There were a bunch of great quotes
in it tying skateboarding in with computers programmers/hackers:

> Take what other people do. Make it better. Give it back so we all rise
> further.

And explaining exactly why so many people enjoy programming,
skateboarding, making music, and any other type of creation:

> There is an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of
> creating it.

This is why we do what we do. Keep doing it, not for the success, fame,
or money, but for the sake of creating.
