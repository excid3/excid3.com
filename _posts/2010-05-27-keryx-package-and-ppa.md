I’m happy to anounce, as of today Keryx now has an Ubuntu package and PPA available for installation. You can now add the [Keryx PPA][1] to your Ubuntu system and install Keryx easily.

Some of you may be wondering, what good is this? Well if you’re online machine runs Ubuntu, you can easily install Keryx on there and you no longer have to fiddle with Keryx on your flash drive (depending on your choice of installation methods). You can now get Keryx updates easily by updating APT like normal as well! ![:D][2]
