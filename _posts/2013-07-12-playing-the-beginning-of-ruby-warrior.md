I’ve had some fun recently playing Ryan Bate’s [Ruby Warrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior). It’s a little text based adventure game where you build the AI for the player. Each level gets increasingly more difficult so you start writing more and more complex code. As you go along, you can get caught in the complexity of the code, so I made this video to help give examples of how I was handling the first few levels of complexity.

So without further adieu, here’s the video. This was recorded off the cuff without any editing so it won’t be the greatest, but hopefully you’ll pickup a trick or two. The screen resolution is fairly high, so you may want to watch this either in fullscreen or on Youtube in HD.
