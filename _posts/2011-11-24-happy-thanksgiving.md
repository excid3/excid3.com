I want to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving! I’m incredibly greatful for all the great people I’ve met this past year. It’s been an amazing experience and my only hope is that I can improve other people’s lives as much as they have improved mine.

It’s not often we take time to say thanks for everything we’ve got. Even on Thanksgiving. We have computers, fast internet, plenty of food, shelter, a cars. Be thankful not just today, but everday. (I’m looking at you occupiers, you’ve got way more than a lot of people.)

Take a few minutes to think about what you take for granted on a daily basis. Tell your family you love them. Say thanks to people at the grocery store or restaurant. Share the love.

Don’t eat too much!
