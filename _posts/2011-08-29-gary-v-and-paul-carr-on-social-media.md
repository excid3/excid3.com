I think Paul brings up some important points especially around the idea that people changing their avatars to green making it feel like they are making a difference. However, all-in-all I think he’s wrong about it and that Gary’s right in that social media creates a lot of small wins that add up in the bigger picture better than it would without that interaction.

If anything it is certainly an interesting debate!
