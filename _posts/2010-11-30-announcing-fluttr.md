I’ll be the first to admit that I’m no god with Rails development. I know the basics, and I can get things done relatively quickly, but a lot of my experience is editing other people’s apps. Feeling like I was missing out on a lot of the underlying things, I figured it was a good idea to create an app which I (and hopefully others) would use daily.

If you’ve ever used Google Tasks, you’ll nod in agreement when I say that it’s pretty crappy. Living without a todo list is kind of hard, but I haven’t found anything I liked too much yet either. What do I do? Might as well build my own and learn some Rails and Ajax while I’m doing it.

Introducing: **Fluttr**


I learned some Ajax, some Rails, and got it all done in under 4 hours (including time to learn what I wasn’t familiar with). Not too shabby, and I enjoyed it a lot. It’s open source for anyone interested in running their own copy or adding their own features.
