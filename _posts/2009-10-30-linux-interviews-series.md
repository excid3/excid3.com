Friend of mine on twitter, Jacob Kuehndorf ([@BIOSShadow][1]) runs  and recently started up a blog series with interviews of Linux users from all sorts of different walks of life. I was graciously asked to be interviewed and you can find my interview here: http://www.geekcrack.org/2009/10/28/linux-interviews-excid3/. Be sure to check out all the other great interviews and stop by IRC at irc://irc.liquidbabble.com/slackstuff!
