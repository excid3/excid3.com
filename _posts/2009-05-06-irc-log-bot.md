From now on, at least while I have internet connectivity, #keryx on irc.freenode.net shall be logged with my own custom made IRC bot using Python-irclib. If any discussion happens you will be able to review the logs later on at your on discretion. Logs will be stored at http://keryxproject.org/logs for anyone who is interested. Source code for the IRC bot can be found on my blogâ€™s project page at [http://excid3.com/projects/logbot][1]. Enjoy!
