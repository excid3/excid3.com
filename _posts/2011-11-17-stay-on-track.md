A few weeks ago, I decided that I would write more. I’ve always liked writing but I rarely did.

I know I’m not the only one that feels like this, but finishing things is hard. We start hundreds of projects, only to get started and then never complete them.

For me, I wanted to write more blog posts. I decided that every week I would post something. After a while, step it up a notch and write something twice a week. Things were great. I had stuck to my goal well for quite a while.

Monday I didn’t have a blog post ready to go out. I missed my deadline. It was a personal deadline so it didn’t really matter. Right? That’s what I told myself.

Hell no. It mattered a lot. I sat there thinking about it the next day. Am I really going to just let it end like that? I thought about not writing at all this week because it was so easy just skip writing and do something unproductive.

What a terrible thought.

I just about gave up writing then and there. It was hard to find time. It was hard to find ideas. Things got tough and I said whatever, maybe later.

If you really want to get better at something don’t give up. Fight through the hard times. It might take a long time, but you will get there. People might say you’re terrible at it. People might laugh at you. Who cares? It’s your life, not theirs.

Just don’t give up. Finish what you set out to do.
