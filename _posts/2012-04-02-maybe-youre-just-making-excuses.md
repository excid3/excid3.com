Successful people must have a property about them that makes them successful. The media likes to explain this as being magical. This is rarely the case. What you don’t see is the years of hard work put into learning the ropes.

Rovio spent 8 years developing games before Angry Birds was a hit. Zuckerberg spent hours upon hours getting good at programming before he could actually build the first version of Facebook. Steve Jobs got fired from Apple before he came back and turned the company around. Failure and hard work are things they embraced.

> I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.
**Michael Jordan**

Failure is just a part of life. Don’t fear it. Maybe you’re just making excuses.
