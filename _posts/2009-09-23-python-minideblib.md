Keryx 1.0 development recently took a completely different direction. Thanks to community memeber Jaseen, we have come across [python-minideblib][1]. This library takes care of a lot of the features we were manually porting to Python. Harnessing this library has been easy with only a few modifications being required so that we can run it cross platform and interface with the new libkeryx database structure. All is looking well and should be an alpha release of Keryx 1.0 CLI soon.
