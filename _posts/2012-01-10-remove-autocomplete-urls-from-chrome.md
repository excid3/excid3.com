At some point yesterday I was doing my usual email checking. It’s a habit I have when I’m not sure what to do: I hit the keyboard shortcut for opening a new tab and type “`g`” and hit enter. I’ve opened up GMail enough times with this shortcut that it always autocompletes first.

However, something I ended up doing yesterday submitted just the letter “g” instead. Now every time it autocompletes that to my Charter search. Horrible.

If you need to remove a website from Chrome’s autocomplete suggestions, it’s really simple:


    Fn   Shift   Delete while highlighting the website you want to remove

Simple as that. I’ve also read just `Shift Delete` works if you’re not on a Mac. Do you have any other protips?
