        <p>Our software process starts with getting to know you, your product, and your goals. Knowing how you operate and what you're trying to accomplish helps us stay focused on what matters to you.</p>
        <blockquote>A lot of software teams will tell you to use their existing software, but we want to do what's right for you.</blockquote>
        <p>You may feel that your software needs redesigned from the ground up and we can do that.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of cases where your software just needs a piece added or revamped, not the entire thing.</p>
