        <p>Building businesses online are hard. Great software is hard to come by and when you do it's hard to tell what makes it special.</p>
        <p>Growing your online customer base becomes tough and it's frustrating.</p>
        <p>You don't know what your missing, but it seems like it should be obvious. Your competitors seem to "get it" but you also don't want to be like them.</p>

      <div class="span6 offset3">
        <p>Since we live and breathe software, we spend a whole lot of time reviewing other people's work.</p>
        <p>Over the years we've been able to see patterns. There are reasons why <a href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar Shave Club</a> is so popular with men. Why <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a> can gather such an intense following. And why <a href="http://pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> seemingly blew up all of a sudden.</p>

      <div class="span8 offset2">
        <h1 class="centered">So how do we become like them?</h1>

      <div class="span6 offset3">
        <p>Software can only be great when it truly understands their users. It's important to know who they are and what they're trying to accomplish.</p>
        <p>Most people have assumptions of who their users are, but it's only a ballpark.</p>
        <h3>A/B testing</h3>
        <p>A/B testing is a way of presenting users two separate web pages to determine which one is better. For example, we can try different taglines on your homepage to determine which tagline potential customers understand more.</p>
        <p>After we have collected enough data, you'll be able to tell which tagline your customers understand the most.</p>
        <p><strong>Improving little things like this can be the difference between you and Amazon, Facebook, or Google.</strong></p>
        <p>Each of these companies puts extensive amount of time and effort into testing each and every piece of their software. They want to be sure that everything they're doing increases the amount of interactions their customers have with them.</p>
        <h3>Site Optimization</h3>
        <p>Search engine optimization and performance optimization may also be on your list of improvements to make. We have expertise building responsive and well structured websites to handle both with ease.</p>
        <p>Every piece of your website matters. From your button text to the registration process, we can help you determine where improvements can be made to grow the customers you get each month.</p>
