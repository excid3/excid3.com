## Where did the username "excid3" come from?

I was tired coming up with different usernames for every site and wanted
something consistent. I opened the dictionairy with my eyes closed.
Pointed at a word randomly and found "excide". I changed the last "e" to a
"3" so I was pretty sure it would never be taken, and that was that.
